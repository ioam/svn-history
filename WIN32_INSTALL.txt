INSTALLING TOPOGRAPHICA ON WINDOWS XP/2000/(NT?)
===================================================================

(Not tested recently, as of 11/2005, and will likely need some
modification).

THE FAST WAY:

1. Unpack the topographica archive into a temporary directory.
2. Double click on setup.bat
3. Follow the various installation prompts for the packages 
   bundled with Topographica.
4. Add "DISLIN=C:\DISLIN" and "PYTHONPATH=C:\DISLIN\PYTHON"
   to your System Variables.  To do so go to the [Control Panel], 
   double click on [System], select the [Advanced] tab, and then 
   the button [Environment Variables].

After installation you should now have an icon on your desktop that
opens the directory where Topographica is installed.  There will be a
new file association called ".ty" which are scripts that the
Topographica program will execute when you double-click on them.

You can now test the installation by double-clicking on the
topographica.bat file which will run the interactive Topographica
shell and give you a "Topographica>" prompt.


===================================================================

IF THERE IS A PROBLEM

Known issues: 

Sometimes on Windows 2000 Machines the Dislin setup.exe program will
not exit cleanly after the install.  The Topographica installation has
completed successfully but the final notice that says to add the
DISLIN and PYTHONPATH environment variables will not be displayed.

If you experience the error:
  File "C:\Python23\lib\string.py", line 220, in atoi 
    return _int(s, base)
TypeError: int() can't convert non-string with explicit base

Then you may be running an old version of Python.  Check your
Environment Variables in "My Computer -> Properties" to make sure you
don't have an old version of Python earlier in your path statement
that is running first.

INSTALLING THE SLOW WAY

To install the Topographica parts by hand, be sure Python 2.4 is
installed and do (a), (b), and (c) below.  See Note.
---

Topographica is a Python 2.4 program and requires Python 2.4 to be
installed.  The setup.bat script checks to see if the correct version
exists and if an older version is the default Python associated with
Python Files then an included Python 2.4 installer located in
\external\ will be run.

After Python has been installed or detected, the directory is changed
to .\external\win32\ and following commands are run:

   start /wait setup.py configure     % Verifies Python 2.4 installed.
   start /wait setup.py install


The 'setup.py install' does the following:

a) Installs the following programs found in external\win32\

   Numeric-23.7.win32-py2.4.exe Python Numeric Package
   PIL-1.1.5b3.win32-py2.4.exe	Python Imaging Library
   ..\Pmw.tgz                   Python Mega Widgets  (Contains a Read-Me)
   dl_83_py.tar.gz              Dislin Plotting      (Runs setup.exe)

b) Copy the core Topographica files in \topo\* to the install location
   BASE_LOCATION\topo\

c) Additional tasks in the script include (in no particular order):
   1. Associate Topographica File extensions (.ty).
   2. Give .ty Files a pretty icon.
   3. Construct a Topographica run command that is named topographica.py.
      This can be run directly, or through topographica.bat:
   4. Create a topographica.bat wrapper for running Topographica.
   5. Create a Desktop CMD file to open the Install location of Topographica
   
Note: The "Additional Tasks" of part (c) listed above are only for
      streamlining the Topographica user interface and are not needed
      to run the system.  If there is a problem with the install
      script and (c) does not complete then Topographica can still be
      executed by issuing the following command from a Shell window
      that is in the root location of the Topographica installation:

         [Python Location]\python.exe topographica.py

      To execute an existing Topographica script add the filename to
      the end of the command:

         [Python Location]\python.exe topographica.py script.py
