Files for setting up CVS-controlled Topographica 
************************************************

Files in this directory allow a CVS-controlled copy of Topographica to
be set up on Windows. 

Run setup.bat.



Notes
-----

* After running topographica -g, if you get an error about pylab:
  - quit topographica
  - start without the gui
  - try to import pylab
  - if you get an error about MSVCP71.DLL (or MSVCR71.DLL) being missing...find it 
    from the web and put it in windows\system32.
