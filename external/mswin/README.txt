Files for setting up Topographica on Windows
********************************************

Files at this level in the directory allow a CVS-controlled copy of
Topographica to be setup on Windows; they are used by the 'setup.bat' 
script in the main Topographica directory (i.e. these files are not
intended for standalone use).

Files in the for_binaries/ subdirectory allow an installation package 
to be created for Topographica.
