"""
Commands for running the examples files in various ways.

Like a Makefile: contains a list of targets (and groups of targets)
that specify various commands to run.

E.g.
 ./topographica -c 'targets=["all_quick","saved_examples"]' examples/run.py 

Runs the 'all_quick' target if called without any arguments: 
 ./topographica examples/run.py 


To add new single targets, just add to the targets dictionary;
for groups of targets, add to the group_targets dictionary.

### NOTES
#
# - Tricky to get this to work on Windows because of problems
#   with quotes, spaces, and so on in cmd.exe:
#   http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-bugs-list/2002-March/010393.html
#   http://support.microsoft.com/kb/191495
#   So, currently have to take care over where this script is run from
#   (covered by an assertion statement), and how to pass in commands
#   (e.g. strings for printing - see trickysyntax target).
#   I might have become confused by all this, so there's likely to be
#   something simpler we could do - this script contains the history of
#   its production in the code (e.g. I probably don't need the full
#   path to the topographica script in here anymore.)
#
# - has none of the Makefile's dependency processing, so just does
#  what you tell it (i.e. over-writes existing files - which might be
#  behavior we actually want).

## location of the examples directory
# CEBALERT: problem with paths on windows for passing in the script name to
# run; should be:

examples = "examples"
# temporary (I hope) test to ensure script is run from the topographica main directory
