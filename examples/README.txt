This directory contains example Topographica simulation scripts,
including:

  tiny.ty              - short, simple, fast example
  cfsom_or.ty          - Simple example of a SOM network with ConnectionFields  
  hierarchical.ty      - Simple example of connecting multiple maps
  lissom_oo_or.ty      - LISSOM orientation map with ON/OFF channels
  lissom_oo_or_dy.ty   - LISSOM orientation/disparity map with ON/OFF channels
  lissom_oo_dr.ty      - LISSOM orientation/direction map with ON/OFF channels
  lissom_or.ty	       - LISSOM orientation map with no ON/OFF channels
  lissom_photo_or.ty   - LISSOM orientation map using natural images
  lissom_whisker_barrels.ty - LISSOM whisker barrel cortex simulation
  obermayer_pnas90.ty  - SOM orientation map
  som_retinotopy.ty    - SOM retinotopy map

Other scripts may also be included, but these are likely to be works
in progress, incomplete, or otherwise not particularly useful.  Once a
script has become useful, it should be placed into the above list 
(and topographica/Makefile altered to ensure that it is not removed
from public distributions).
