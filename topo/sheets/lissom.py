class JointNormalizingCFSheet(CFSheet):
    """
    A type of CFSheet extended to support joint sum-based normalization.

    For L1 normalization, joint normalization means normalizing the
    sum of (the absolute values of) all weights in a set of
    corresponding CFs in different Projections, rather than only
    considering weights in the same CF.

    This class makes it possible for a model to use joint
    normalization, by providing a mechanism for grouping Projections
    (see _port_match), plus a learn() function that computes the joint
    sums.  Joint normalization also requires having ConnectionField
    store and return a norm_total for each neuron, and having an
    OutputFn that will respect this norm_total rather than the strict
    total of the ConnectionField's weights.  At present,
    CFPOF_DivisiveNormalizeL1 and CFPOF_DivisiveNormalizeL1_opt do use
    norm_total; others can be extended to do something similar if
    necessary.

    To enable joint normalization, you can declare that all the
    incoming connections that should be normalized together each
    have a dest_port of:

    dest_port=('Activity','JointNormalize', 'AfferentGroup1'),

    Then all those that have this dest_port will be normalized
    together, as long as an appropriate OutputFn is being used.
