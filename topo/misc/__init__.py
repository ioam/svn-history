"""
Miscellaneous functions used by Topographica files outside topo.base.

This package should be self-contained, i.e., should not refer to any
other part of Topographica.  For instance, no file may include an
import statement like 'from topo.package.module import' or 'import
topo.package.module'.  Thus these files should be easily available for
anyone to copy and use in their own unrelated projects; they are not
specific to Topographica in any way.
