	* topo/base/cf.py 1.86: modified code to speed up the Iterators a
	bit

	* topo/learningfns/projfns.py 1.23, topo/responsefns/projfns.py
	1.20: modified code to _actually_ use the iterators

2007-04-12  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.70: small changes to orientation
	tuning curve parameter so that orientation values only plotted
	between 0 and pi

	* topo/commands/pylabplots.py 1.20: changed tuning curves,
	orientation tuning curves now plotted differently as
	or_tuning_curve, values rotated to make maximum more likely to be
	in the center

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.65: changed tuning curves,
	orientation tuning curves now plotted differently, some template
	tuning curve parameters no longer required

2007-04-12  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

2007-04-11  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.87: Updated docstrings

	* topo/learningfns/projfns.py 1.22: Fixed to work with recent Mask
	implementation

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.50: Turned on activity plotting by
	default

	* doc/User_Manual/modeleditor_text.php 1.4: Added information
	about saving the script_repr

	* doc/User_Manual/modeleditor_text.php 1.3: Reformatted to add
	line breaks for readability of the source code; no visible changes

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.62, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.132:
	Added save_script_repr command and GUI option

2007-04-11  antolikjan  <antolikjan@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or_noshrinking_latswitch.ty 1.7,
	examples/joublin_bc96.ty 1.15, examples/lissom_or_homeoscale.ty
	1.10, topo/responsefns/projfns.py 1.19,
	topo/learningfns/projfns.py 1.21, topo/learningfns/som.py 1.17:
	modified code to use the new iterators

	* topo/sheets/optimized.py 1.3: A new class implementing a C
	optimized version of the NeighbourhoodMask class was added

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.56: Changed the code to use the
	new iterators. Also the C code was modified to use directly the
	new mask that is accessed through the iterator to optimize code.

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.46, topo/learningfns/optimized.py
	1.68: Changed the code to use the new iterators

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.58: The SharedWeightProjection was
	now changed to use the new iterators

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.85: Two iterators were added to the code. Both
	of these iterate through connection fields of given
	projection. The base iterator iterates through all projections
	fields whereas the dervied Mask iterator iterates only over
	connection fields corresponding to the unmasked positions. All
	code in cf.py was changed to use these iterators instead of
	directly accessing _cfs

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.71: The code was modified to use the new
	mask optimization. Particularly the initialization and the reset
	of the mask was added to the timing logic of the LISSOM class

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.86: Two new classes were added
	SheetMask and derived NeighborhoodMask that define the masking for
	the new optimization. The ProjectionSheet mask now owns a new
	parameter that points to one of these masks (the SheetMask by
	default)

2007-04-11  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/__init__.py 1.17, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.131:
	Added alert.

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.84: Made autosize mask be a hidden parameter
	so it doesn't show up in the GUI.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.130: Added comment.

	* Makefile 1.99: Reduced precision of tests, so that results from
	one processor (checked into CVS) can still be tested on another.

2007-04-10  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.129: Updated comment.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.128: Added HACKALERT.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.127: Also make menubar cascades
	activate when the cursor is over them.

	* topo/tkgui/__init__.py 1.16: Moved code for making cascades open
	automatically to topoconsole. Removed commented-out code. Console
	is already resizable - doesn't need to be specified.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.126: Main menu is Pmw.MainMenuBar,
	so is now a proper Toplevel menu (should display as a native menu
	bar i.e. along the top for OS X). Minor re-organization of
	methods. Context-sensitive help for menus temporarily
	disabled. Asks for confirmation before quitting. Clicking 'x' on
	the window is like quitting from the menu (rather than just
	closing the topoconsole window). Moved in code for making cascades
	open automatically (from __init__.py).

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.187: Update weave. Removed
	startup commands task (at least it works, although it might need
	improving).

2007-04-09  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.125: Enabled icon, to see if it is

	code to display an icon on the console.

2007-04-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.122: Changed note into ALERT.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.121: Added note: when did the status
	bar stop showing help text for menu commands?

2007-04-05  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.143: Added test that the console
	has not already been destroyed before destroying a plotgrouppanel.

	also works on Windows.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.59: Moved alert.

	* topo/tests/test_script.py 1.18: Added alert & commented out
	speed assertion statement.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.116: Added popup help to buttons
	on parameters frame. The buttons are still likely to be confusing,
	though.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.185: Added task.

	* Makefile 1.98: Added comment.

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.70: Minor change to comment.

	* topo/base/simulation.py 1.60, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.69: Added
	'execute_next' parameter, which is a list of commands that will be
	executed when the simulation is next run(), and which are
	guaranteed only to run once. Might need to be reviewed (but fixes
	repeated-normalization bug).

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.184: Updates to various of my
	tasks.

2007-04-05  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.183: Added documentation
	notes

2007-04-05  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.142: Commented out scrollbars, so
	behavior of all plotgrouppanels should revert.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.182: Moved examples/Makefile
	task to complete before release.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.181: Added some tasks to
	complete for the release.

2007-04-04  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/setup.py 1.3: Continued working on quickly translating
	the Makefile. Probably finished, but needs simplifying.

	* external/numpy-1.0.1.tar.gz 1.2: Upgraded to 1.0.2.

	* topo/tests/test_script.py 1.17: Added assertion that speed
	hasn't increased by more than 5%.

	* external/.cvsignore 1.23, external/Makefile 1.59: Upgraded to
	numpy 1.0.2 (which, for us, primarily fixes the subtract-reduce
	bug. All slow-tests pass, and make compare_oo_or passes too. Some
	speeds appear to have improved: lissom_or_homeoscale increased by
	8%, and lissom_oo_od by 4.5%. Other scripts did not change in
	speed by more than 1%. (Some of the speed tests are still a little
	short to be completely reliable.)

	* external/numpy-1.0.2.tar.gz 1.1: From numpy.scipy.org

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.66: 'Duration to present for' and
	'Apply to pattern in' boxes no longer expand.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.141: Renamed a variable.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.140: Use ParameterizedObject from
	topo.base.parameterizedobject.

	1.139, topo/tkgui/projectionactivitypanel.py 1.4,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.67,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.56,
	topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.65, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.119:
	BasicPlotGroupPanel inherits from Toplevel instead of Frame
	because it's a window, not a Frame.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.138,
	topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.115: Added comment.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.180: Added task to do before
	upcoming release.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.137: Added HACKALERT.

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.55: Added alert.

	* topo/tests/testplotgrouppanel.py 1.12,
	topo/tests/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py 1.11,
	topo/tkgui/__init__.py 1.15, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.118:
	TopoConsole is the main application window, so it inherits from
	Tkinter.Tk: this eliminates an extra frame.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.136: Removed some unused imports.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.135: Enabled scrollbars for
	plots. Scrolling needs to be re-implemented after tkgui is cleaned
	up.

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.54: Fixed some widget
	expansions.

	GUIToplevel class.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.134: Removed apparently unused
	frame.

	* topo/__init__.py 1.69, topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.34,
	topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.62, topo/base/simulation.py
	1.59: Slightly improved script_repr's collection of import
	statements. Should be no change to behavior.

	* topo/base/simulation.py 1.58: Should have been present in
	previous checkin: generate import statements for connections.

	* topo/__init__.py 1.68, topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.33,
	topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.61, topo/base/simulation.py
	1.57: Quick way to have script_repr() produce import
	statements. Needs to be re-implemented more cleanly.

	* topo/misc/inlinec.py 1.14: Minor change to warning text.

2007-03-30  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	lissom_oo_or_reference matching cleanup. Merged some duplicate
	tasks. Added a new task.

2007-03-29  jprovost  <jprovost@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.49, topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py
	1.39: Made EditorObjects inherit from ParameterizedObject and
	added some parameters, so that the default view type
	(activity/normal) can be set in a script or in the
	.topographicarc.

2007-03-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	exists in PIL (or in Windows, possibly - at least I don't think
	it's possible for us to control where the jpeg library is found
	when using the pre-built binary).

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.172: Had already added gnosis
	utils.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.171: Updated topographica-win

	* Makefile 1.97: Added comment.

2007-03-28  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	1.3: Temporary addition to cf.py: a parameter that allows the size
	of the mask to be overridden. Eye-Ganglia initial weights match to
	6 d.p. for c++ lissom and topographica (Primary afferents still
	match to 8 d.p., as before; 6 d.p. is probably the best value
	possible with Gaussian patterns, and is the same as for Gaussian
	patterns on the Eye). The Eye-Ganglia matching happens because
	Ganglia patterns are drawn with radius r_L (as in c++ lissom),
	rather than with the radius of the actual connection
	field. Additionally, there are some other minor changes that might
	be reverted.

	Initial version.
	
	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.133: Made status bar look like
	topoconsole's. (Should it also have a labeled frame round it?)

2007-03-28  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.170: Made first section be
	the actual tasks left for the 0.9.3 release

	'duration' box causes the pattern to be presented.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.115: Added to comments.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.132: Changed dynamic info to be
	displayed in a Pmw MessageBar. The message bar expands to fill the
	window's width, so we see as much of a message as possible in the
	current window. The message bar does not expand automatically for
	long messages, so the window size does not change rapidly when the
	message length changes rapidly.

2007-03-28  jprovost  <jprovost@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.38: Removed some spurious code.

	are now circular.

2007-03-27  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.53: Added abs to fft

	right-click menu expansibility

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.60: Made lists of

	mishmash.  Made script_repr_suppress_defaults into a module
	attribute so that it wouldn't show up on script_repr output

	* topo/base/simulation.py 1.55: Added script_repr representations
	of schedule_command events and topo.sim.name.  Added section
	headings.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or_noshrinking.ty 1.4: Added another fix from

	* examples/sullivan_nn06.ty 1.15, topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.65:
	Removed unused imports

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.76: Small cleanup in preparation for later
	changes; should not change the behavior.  Removed duplicate
	get_shape command, keeping the tuple version (not the 2-element
	array version)

	* examples/Makefile 1.20: Added lissom_fsa target

	checkbutton, and tried to make window resizing reasonable. If
	auto-resize is on, the window automatically fits the widgets, and
	the user cannot resize it. If auto-resize is off, the user can
	resize the window and it is never resized automatically.

	* external/Makefile 1.58: Removed numeric target. Left the
	-uninstall and -clean targets for the moment.

	* external/Numeric-24.0.tar.gz 1.2: No longer used (replaced by

	loading of .topographicarc file in $HOME, if one exists.

	* topo/misc/utils.py 1.40: Added signabs function.

	* topo/coordmapperfns/basic.py 1.5: Minor code cleanup.

	* topo/commands/pylabplots.py 1.16: Added functions for plotting
	sheet activity and coordinate mappings.

	and modified CallableParameter to allow instance methods to be
	pickled.

	* topo/sheets/saccade.py 1.1: Moved saccade.py from examples into
	the library.

	* examples/saccade.py 1.5, examples/saccade_demo.ty 1.5: - Cleaned
	up saccade_demo.ty - Moved saccade.py into topo/sheets

	* topo/tests/test_script.py 1.12: Turn on garbage collection
	during speed measurement.

2007-03-22  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or_noshrinking.ty 1.8: changed radius of lateral
	excitatory connections to get better organisation

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.119: made default smoothing for
	SineGratingDisk = 0, otherwise gives strange results for tuning
	curves

2007-03-22  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.18: No longer disable pickle
	test. Corrected variable name error introduced in previous
	checkin. Added comment.

	* topo/tests/testplotgrouppanel.py 1.11: Instead of a second input
	pattern, use the one created in setUP().

	* topo/tests/testpatternpresent.py 1.17,
	topo/tests/testplotgrouppanel.py 1.10,
	topo/tests/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py 1.10: Input parameters
	set on an instance, rather than a class.

	* topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.35: Input parameters set on an
	instance of Gaussian, rather than the class. Changed to a Gaussian
	pattern from a Line (since it looked like Gaussian was originally
	intended...).

	* topo/tests/test_script.py 1.11: Added comment.

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.17: Unit test suite is not generated
	until run() is called, meaning all the 'checking module x for test
	suite...found' lines are not printed every time a file from
	topo/tests/ is used.

	* Makefile 1.93: Updated to match speed test changes.

	* topo/tests/test_script.py 1.10: Speed tests use Python's timeit
	module. Speed test data includes number of iterations, so that the
	number of iterations will match in the comparison.

2007-03-21  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile 1.92: Fixed previous checkin; was regenerating each
	time

	would not have worked for non-square input sheets

	* topo/coordmapperfns/basic.py 1.4: Minor updates and fixes to
	docstrings

	* Makefile 1.91: Generalized to accept any list of script files
	for the slow-tests and speed-tests targets, and made generation of
	reference data be automatic

	of some timing functions.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.165: Correction to a task
	(testsnapshots.py is not a slow test).

	* Makefile 1.88: Added slow-tests target.

	* topo/tests/test_script.py 1.6: Added option to specify data file
	location.

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or.ty_DATA 1.1,

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.62: Added minor alert.

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.51: Minor simplification
	- no visible change.

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.50: _canvas_right_click()
	calls the super class's version first, before adding extra
	information to the menu.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.127: Displaying the popup menu is
	optional for _canvas_right_click().

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.49: Added some notes.

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.75: Added comment to ALERT about speed of
	access to norm_total property.

2007-03-20  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_photo_or.ty 1.2: Added changes listed in CMVC
	appendix A.5.2; not yet tested

	* examples/lissom_photo_or.ty 1.1: Initial version identical to
	lissom_oo_or.ty

2007-03-20  antolikjan  <antolikjan@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/test_script.py 1.5: The TestScript now takes second
	argument that forces only approximate comparison within the
	decimal precission specified by the additional argument. If this
	argument is set to None (default) the script works as before

2007-03-20  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.48: Added workaround for
	Connection Field plot right-clicks

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.126,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.47: Added more info to the
	right-click menu to clarify what each item represents

	* doc/Tutorials/lissom_or_text.php 1.6: Updated training time
	estimates

2007-03-20  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.46: Begun adding channels
	to right-click menu and dynamic info line. Parts are more complex
	than necessary (I hope), and should become simpler.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.125: Minor tidy and
	__canvas_right_click is semi-private.

2007-03-19  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.45: Updated to use
	_right_click_info. No need to catch IndexError now r,c values will
	always be valid for the sheet.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.124: Distinguish between
	right-click event (which needs to persist for submenu commands)
	and other events (which are no longer stored, since they should be
	used immediately or discarded). Events that do not occur on a plot
	of a sheet (or that occur on a plot of a sheet, but not within the
	sheet bounds) are distinguishable from those that do by the
	presence of 'plot' rather than 'coords'.

2007-03-19  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.164: Removed duplicate task

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.122: Update dynamic info after
	clicking off right-click menu. Update dynamic info after leaving a
	plot, rather than just setting it to an empty string.

2007-03-18  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.121: Added an alert.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.120: Anything using
	__process_canvas_event_info() now gets the correct information
	about a sheet at the edge of a plot (so e.g. the dynamic info does
	not indicate the mouse is on a sheet unit when in fact it is on
	the plot's border).

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.119: Dynamic info. text is only
	present when mouse is inside a plot.

	* topo/tkgui/__init__.py 1.12: On linux, cascading menu options
	now show up when the mouse is over the menu entry. However, there
	is now an extra partial menu bar at the top of topoconsole.

	* topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.35: Removed comment.

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.44: 'Update command'
	executed if return is pressed or an item is selected from the
	ComboBox.

	the dynamic label.

	* topo/tkgui/__init__.py 1.11: Added comment about fonts.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.116: Right-click submenus have
	correct master (previously, on linux, the menu items could only be
	selected with the keyboard, not the mouse).

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.115: Added to a comment.

2007-03-17  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.114: Uncommented connection
	fields-launching menu code, so connection fields can be opened
	from the right-click menu.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.110: PlotsMenuEntry's command()
	takes optional arguments, which are passed onto the class (plot
	window, or whatever) that is created.

	* topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.34: The
	ConnectionFieldsPanel's x any y values can optionally be specified
	on creation.

	apply_learn_output_fn and compute_joint_norm_totals.  Now this mask
	is set to the activity of neurons, thus preventing unnecessary
	recomputation of weights of inactive neurons

	fn to work with the new form of norm_total property by directly
	accessing _norm_total and has_norm_total

	rather than deleting the _norm_total atribute, uses a
	has_norm_total flag to indicate the validity of norm_total

	* doc/User_Manual/patterns_text.php 1.8: Specified smoothing value
	for disks explicitly

	* doc/User_Manual/patterns_text.php 1.7: Updated for numpy

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.109: Changed default Composite pattern

	1.53, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.66: SharedWeightCFProjection has
	been reimplemented by Jan Antolik to have a cfs data structure
	(now renamed _cfs to discourage direct usage) that is nearly
	entirely compatible with the one from CFProjection.  The shared
	_cfs now contains a CF for every neuron, where the weights are all
	views (slices) of a single shared CF that stores the actual
	weights.  Apart from the sharing, it works just like in
	CFProjection.

	This allowed us to remove the special DummyCF and
	CFPRF_SharedWeightDotProduct_opt classes entirely, replacing them
	with the standard ConnectionField and CFPRF_DotProduct_opt
	(modified to allow non-contiguous arrays).

	External code should now avoid using _cfs.  To get the shape of
	the projection without accessing _cfs, a new property
	CFProjection.cfs_shape has been added.  The projections have also
	been simplified to store the bounds_template internally, rather
	than sending it around as a parameter.

	The result should be much simpler to maintain, test, and
	understand, but at least on lissom_oo_or.ty the results are
	unchanged.

	Updated to use numpy instead of Numeric, on a separate CVS branch
	named numpy_test_branch.  First, ran the automatic conversion
	code:

	  import numpy.oldnumeric.alter_code1 as noa
	  noa.converttree('topo') noa.convertall('examples') 
	  # (After temporarily renaming .ty to .py)

	The main automatic changes were:

	  - Changed 'import Numeric' to 'import numpy.oldnumeric as Numeric' 
	  - Changed 'from Numeric import' to 'from numpy.oldnumeric import'
	  - Converted .flat to .ravel() 
	  - Changed typecode= to dtype= 
	  - Eliminated savespace() and spacesaver()

	Then cleaned up the results by hand:

	  - Removed all traces of savespace 
	  - Replaced custom ExtraPickler and ExtraUnpickler with standard
	    pickle.Pickler and pickle.Unpickler
          - Used 'from numpy import inf' instead of the previous ad-hoc
            way of generating an infinite float.  Cleaned up and
            simplified handling of division-by-zero and underflow errors
            for Gaussian-based patterns.
          - Updated weave version to work with numpy.  Also adds full
	    SciPy distribution, although it is not yet unpacked and built
	    automatically
          - Upgraded matplotlib to work with numpy.
          - Patched numpy to fix bug in numpy.subtract.reduce.
          - Removed the Wrapper class entirely, now that numpy's ufuncs
	    deepcopy without problems.
          - Changed numpy array printing to show the actual data for any
	    array up to 200*200 by default.
          - Removed -Wl from LD_FLAGS for compiling Python, to make it
	    compile on OS X 10.4.8 (intel and ppc) even though that
	    platform does not have or need the -rpath option

2007-02-22  jprovost  <jprovost@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/__init__.py 1.59: Enabled strict reporting of
	floating-point errors as exceptions by default, to facilitate
	debugging of numpy, but disabled underflow error reporting by

	stores that bounds_tamplate internally rather than sending it
	around as a parameter. Further restricitng the access to cfs by

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.20: Now prints the
	smallest number of decimal places to which C++ LISSOM and
	Topographica match for various items.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.16:
	compare_elements() now returns the smallest number of decimal
	places to which all corresponding elements of two arrays match.

	* topo/tests/utils.py 1.2: Added array_almost_equal() (based on
	assert_array_almost_equal()), which tests whether or not two
	arrays are equal to a specified number of decimal places. Added a
	condition that assert_array_almost_equal is only valid if the
	given number of decimal places is greater than 0.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.19: Added some
	functions to cut down on typing, and updated lissom command.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.15: Minor update to
	an error message.

	* topo/misc/utils.py 1.28: Added repr method to Struct class.

2007-02-03  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.14: Minor
	simplifications.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.13: Removed unused
	code.

	* topo/tests/reference/or_map_topo.param 1.6: Uncommented all the
	scheduled actions (except lat. exc. bounds change).

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.18: Uncommented
	all the scheduled actions (except for lat. exc. bounds change,
	since that starts off too small to shrink further. Added
	commented-out code for comparisons up to t=14000.

2007-02-02  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.17,
	topo/tests/reference/or_map_topo.param 1.5: Reverted times in
	topographica simulation. Uncommented scheduled events for as far
	as I've checked (700 iterations, weights to 6 dp).

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.16: The previous
	commit happened by mistake, although the message was partially
	correct (also commented out all scheduled actions in the c++ and
	topographica simulations; topographica matches the c++ lissom one
	to 6 decimal places in the weights of the central unit after 700
	iterations). Updated c++ lissom command this time.

	* topo/tests/reference/or_map_topo.param 1.4: Commented out all
	scheduled actions.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.12,
	topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.15: compare_elements
	returns more useful information (you can see how what fraction of
	elements match at various numbers of decimal places).

2007-02-02  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.62: removed print statements from
	debugging

2007-02-02  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.14: Slight
	simplification (c++ lissom sheets will always be square).

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.11: Slight
	simplification (c++ lissom sheets will always be square). Added a
	comment and moved some import statements around.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.13: Added
	comparison of retina activities.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.10: Records no. of
	d.p.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.12,
	topo/tests/reference/or_map_topo.param 1.3: The comparison
	simulations use a lower density. There are no excitatory bounds
	changes.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.9: Corrected element
	comparison test (before it was sometimes saying values didn't
	match to a certain number of decimal places, when in fact they did
	(the numbers are floats).

2007-02-01  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.11,
	topo/tests/reference/or_map_topo.param 1.2: Updated
	lissom_or_reference and or_map_topo at the same time, checking
	they match the reference simulation in the book (except with
	BaseN=72, and consequent changes). Currently radii are set to
	specific values for testing; similarly, only some scheduled events
	are present. These files can be made more general later on. At
	this revision, the two simulations' weight values consistently
	match to at least 4 d.p. over 550 iterations (I haven't yet tested
	to more than 4 d.p. or 550 iterations). Both files need to be
	tidied up.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.8: Added missing
	import.

2007-02-01  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	scheduled events.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.8: Removed
	outdated alteration of scheduled-event timings.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.7: Adjust learning
	rates by an amount that is now calculated when the bounds change
	(and hence the number of units changes).

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.6: Updated some
	comments.

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.44.2.3: Removed unused import.

	or_map_topo.log.gz was added on branch numpy_test_branch on
	2007-02-07 14:45:28 +0000

	* topo/tests/reference/.cvsignore 1.3: Ignore or_map_topo.log;
	might remove this line in the future but for now it's the only way
	to make cvs diff feasible for me.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.7,
	topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.33: Moved some
	functions to a more general location so I can use them in
	lissom_or_reference.

	* topo/tests/reference/or_map_topo.param 1.1: Version taken
	straight from the c++ lissom repository (the current version,
	1.15).

	1.12.2.1, examples/laminar_oo_or.ty 1.2.2.1, README.txt 1.17.2.1:
	Updated to use numpy instead of Numeric, on a separate CVS branch
	named numpy_test_branch.  First, ran the automatic conversion
	code:

	  import numpy.oldnumeric.alter_code1 as noa
	  noa.converttree('topo') noa.convertall('examples') # (After
	  temporarily renaming .ty to .py)

	The main automatic changes were:

	  - Change 'import Numeric' to 'import numpy.oldnumeric as
	  Numeric' - Change 'from Numeric import' to 'from
	  numpy.oldnumeric import' - Converted .flat to .ravel() - Changed
	  typecode= to dtype= - Eliminated savespace() and spacesaver()

	Then cleaned up the results by hand, removing all traces of
	savespace, using pickle.Pickler and pickle.Unpickler instead of
	ExtraPickler and ExtraUnpickler, and using 'from numpy import inf'
	rather than the previous ad-hoc way of generating an infinite
	float.  Also disabled optimized components, until we can make it
	all work for the unoptimized ones.  The result should pass most of
	the tests, and run most scripts, but there are still various
	problems to debug.

2007-01-25  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.60: removed parameter inital_plot

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.59: removed contrast response full
	field

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.101: added ProjectionActivity window
	to refresh_activity_windows

2007-01-25  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.138: Removed a task and
	updated another; added some notes for myself.

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.36: Made the new object parameters
	appear in the model editor, rather than as a separate
	window. Needs some tidying up now.

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.36: The root of the editor window
	is not created by calling Tk(), but is created by calling
	Toplevel(). Tk() - which initializes Tk - 'should only be called
	once per application'. This change corrects some strange behavior
	(for example: having a ParametersFrame inside a model editor
	window previously resulted in a non-functional ParametersFrame).

	Removed previous bogus checkin

	* topo/base/arrayutils.py 1.19, topo/base/cf.py 1.64,
	examples/lissom_oo_od.ty 1.10: Fixed boolean comparison against
	array, to be compatible with both Numeric and Numpy

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.47: Added assertion to catch
	confusing problem

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.59: Fixed longstanding bug -- if
	there were multiple input sheets with different sizes (as in
	hierarchical.ty), patterns were being presented by
	PatternPresenter with the same size in each sheet, causing
	undefined behavior for values off the edge of the ConnectionFields
	for each neuron.

2007-01-24  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.44: Changed default argument for
	pattern_present to present an empty set of patterns, rather than
	give an error

	* topo/misc/inlinec.py 1.12: Fixed previous checkin -- was turning
	off optimization by default

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.63, topo/misc/inlinec.py 1.11,
	topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.43, topo/responsefns/optimized.py
	1.50: Moved component substitution code into
	provide_unoptimized_equivalent function for simplicity and to all
	the messages to be disabled when necessary

	* examples/goodhill_network90.ty 1.5: Simplified and changed from
	a CFPLearningFn to a Sheet; no real change in capabilities (other
	than commenting out some code that was not working).

	* examples/goodhill_network90.ty 1.4: Minor cleanup of docstrings
	and comments

2007-01-24  fdemertzis  <fdemertzis@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/goodhill_network90.ty 1.3: Implemented further the
	learning function

2007-01-24  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* external/.cvsignore 1.17, external/Makefile 1.41,
	external/numpy-1.0.1.tar.gz 1.1: Added numpy to allow transition
	from Numeric

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.43: Minor cleanup

	enlarge() and reduce()

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.58, topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py
	1.10, topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.28: Changed
	PlotGroupTemplate.initial_plot to plot_immediately, to avoid
	confusion with the entirely unrelated PlotGroup.initial_plot.
	Made the default *not* to plot immediately, because most
	user-added plots will need to be measured somehow first, which is
	usually slow

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.98: Changed right click to print
	plot name as well as the region name

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.97, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.140: Changed to use plot's new rescale() method, and removed the
	temporary hacks previously required for keeping track of the
	scaling factors (using plot's new scale_factor instead).

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.100: Added method to rescale the images,
	keeping the original image around for later rescaling, and storing
	the current scale_factor

2007-01-23  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.42: in pattern_present if any output_fn
	has a learning parameter then set this to false during
	presentation of patterns

	* topo/outputfns/homeostatic.py 1.6: added learning parameter
	which can turn homeostatic learning off during measurement of maps
	or curves

2007-01-23  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.96: Trivial reformatting of
	docstrings

2007-01-22  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.57, topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py
	1.9, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.100: corrected Contrast Response
	Full field - should be replotted each time unit is changed to
	avoid using wrong orientation

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.58, topo/commands/pylabplots.py
	1.13, topo/plotting/templates.py 1.56,
	topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py 1.8: corrected error in
	prerequisite name, added sheet name to warnings in feature curve
	measurement

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.57: corrected error in parameters
	for measure_or_tuning_fullfield

	* topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py 1.7: added warnings for
	prerequisites

	FeatureCurvePlotGroup to get timestamps from Curve SheetViews

	* topo/commands/pylabplots.py 1.12: changed tuning_curve_data to
	support getting data from SheetViews rather than arrays

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.56: separated warnings for
	prerequisites in measure curves commands so that defaults can be
	used separately

	* topo/analysis/featureresponses.py 1.9: changed curve_dict to
	contain SheetViews rather than activity arrays in FeatureCurves

2007-01-22  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.95: The row and col calculated
	for the matrix of a plot that is right clicked on are integer row
	and column indexes.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.94: Added right click popup menu
	to PlotgroupPanel, showing the row and column of the matrix
	corresponding to where was clicked on a plot. Lots of the code is
	to illustrate how this could be used, but does not currently do
	much.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.138: Added hack to store the
	original scaling factor. Might not be required if that information
	is already available.

2007-01-21  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.27: Trivial cleanup

2007-01-21  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.35: Upgraded hack for 'new object
	properties' window: now clicking on close does not destroy the
	window, but only hides it. This prevents the error messages that
	used to appear if the window was closed but then the user wanted
	to add another new object.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.99: Added comment about clicking the
	window's 'X' to quit.

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.34, topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py
	1.110: Removed Reset button from the ParametersFrame for new
	objects, because reset is not yet implemented for a class in a
	ParametersFrame. Added reminder in parametersframe.

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.33, topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py
	1.109, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.53: Changed how to request
	which buttons a ParametersFrame should display.

2007-01-20  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.137: call command and plot command
	separately

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.54: made command and plot command
	separate in full field curve templates

	* examples/laminar.ty 1.36: corrected name, now laminar_or.ty

	* examples/laminar_or.ty 1.1: version with better self
	organisation

	* examples/laminar_oo_or.ty 1.2: *** empty log message ***

2007-01-20  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	snapshot

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.54: Turned display option off by
	default to allow usage in batch mode

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.136: Set up to be a better starting
	point for using the timestamps saved with curve data

2007-01-19  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.52: ParametersFrame for
	PatternGenerator has only Reset button.

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.32: New object properties window has
	only Reset button. Also added some notes to myself for coming
	changes.

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.45: ParametersFrame itself has
	Apply, Reset, and Ok buttons.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.106: ParametersFrame itself has
	Apply, Reset, and Ok buttons (which can be displayed or
	not). Removed buttons from right-click editing method.

2007-01-19  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/analysis/featureresponses.py 1.8: Fixed curve_dict to be of
	type Float32 instead of Object to allow it to be pickled

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.53: Added proj_name parameter to
	the measure_cog template so that users can tell what to change
	when they don't get a plot

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.53: Changed projection name to make
	measure_cog() work with no edits

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.63, topo/base/sheetview.py 1.18,
	topo/commands/analysis.py 1.53: Fixed Projection plots to use
	timestamps.  Removed inappropriate import of topo into cf.py

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.135,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.26: Changed to use Plot's
	timestamps (created from the SheetView timestamps) rather than the
	current time, to make it obvious when old data is being plotted.
	Made various parts of the code work when there were no plots (or
	only non-resizeable plots), to make it possible to use any plots
	whose data *is* available while not dying when there is no data
	available

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.92: Removed code duplicated
	between PlotGroupPanel.refresh() and BasicPlotGroupPanel.refresh()

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.52,
	topo/analysis/featureresponses.py 1.7, topo/base/cf.py 1.62,
	topo/base/sheetview.py 1.17: Added timestamp to SheetViews

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.99: Added timestamp to Plots.  Added
	warning for when the bitmaps used in the plots become too stale,
	i.e. are too far out of sync in their timestamps

	FullFieldFeatureCurvePanel for special case where full field
	stimulus is used

	* topo/tkgui/featurecurvepanel.py 1.4: correction to
	update_plotgroup_variables to allow update command to be changed
	before refresh

	previous checkin

	* topo/learningfns/projfns.py 1.16: Fixed bug in commented-out BCM

	to PiecewiseLinear_debug2 so that x_avg would be available.

2006-11-24  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

2006-11-24  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile 1.81: Renamed sullivan_neurocomputing06.ty to

2006-11-23  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.102: Having made
	topo.misc.utils.atof() actually return only floats, it no longer
	worked as a translator for non-float (Integer in this case)
	quantities, so switched it for a different one.

2006-11-23  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile 1.79: Removed -g from compare target to avoid popping
	up the GUI at the end

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.132: Fixed trivial typo

2006-11-23  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/misc/utils.py 1.25: Minor change to comments.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.101: Cleaned some comments.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.131: Updated ParametersFrame
	task; I cleaned it up as far as my current knowledge of topo.tkgui
	goes...beyond the changes I made, I'm no better able to clean it
	up than another developer.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.100: Changed the location of the
	hack to avoid TaggedSlider being used to represent Numeric types
	other than floats.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.99: Clean-up: re-ordered two
	methods, made some methods be private.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.98: Removed a hackalert. Made a

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.97: Added more information to a
	comment.

	* topo/misc/utils.py 1.24: Changed eval_atof() so that it produces
	a float from the string it's given, unless that string is the name
	of a variable in __main__, in which case it produces a float from
	the contents of that variable. (I think that's what the original
	aim of the method was.) If in_string, or the contents of the
	variable it represents, does not contain something which can
	legitimately be converted to a float, then string.atof() raises an
	error as it would usually - before, illegitimate input resulted in
	a value of 0 or a non-float.

	* topo/misc/utils.py 1.23, topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py 1.9:
	Moved an ALERT from topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py to
	topo/misc/utils.py.

	* topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py 1.8: The 'optional_action()'
	method was not optional, but it is now. (Fixes a bug where
	pressing return on e.g. test pattern window leads to an error.)

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.32: Now
	advances the simulation time very slightly before comparing
	weights, so that joint normalization has occurred before the
	tests.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.31: Changed
	calling syntax.

	* Makefile 1.78: Changed calling syntax of lissom_oo_or.ty.

2006-11-22  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/reference/Makefile 1.2: Fixed typo in zcat
	definition; should run make clean to re-run reference tests

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.129: Clarified window title
	task

2006-11-22  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.30: Changed
	calling syntax from plots=True/False to plots=1/0 to make it easy
	to specify from Makefile (might not have been necessary).

	* Makefile 1.77: make COMPARISON_PLOTS=1 compare shows plots for
	results that don't match.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_log_parser.py 1.5:
	compare_elements() returns True or False depending on result of
	comparisons.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.29: Continued
	simplification.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.28: Simplified
	setting up a test.

	* Makefile 1.76: Disabled plotting for 'comparisons'.

	* topo/tests/reference/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.27: Prints
	pass/fail information for tests. Plotting optional. Some previous
	tests commented out (there for future use).

2006-11-19  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.125: Removed a task. Any
	developer with a windows machine can recreate the python_topo
	directory, so packages can be updated (e.g. python 2.4.2 to python
	2.4.4 to catch up with the main repository).

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.44, topo/tkgui/editortools.py

	some documentation.

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.47: Updated variable name to match

	metaclass, rather than two. Only one or the other variable was
	used in the past, not both together.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.90: Changed variable name
	topo_class to PO_class since we have ParameterizedObject now, not
	TopoObject. This variable name still isn't good, but I hope this
	file can be reorganized further anyway.

	matching with c++ lissom. Commented out some assert statements,
	which were useful for earlier debugging but are no longer helpful.

2006-11-17  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/joublin_bc96.ty 1.12, topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.52,
	topo/commands/analysis.py 1.41: Changed name of user_function to

	present_input_patterns to ensure that state rolls back after
	presentation of every pattern when measuring maps

	* examples/laminar_lissom.ty 1.17, examples/laminar_nolearning.ty
	1.17, examples/laminar_or_noshrinking.ty 1.3,

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.64, topo/base/cf.py 1.61,
	topo/commands/analysis.py 1.39: Reversed changes - settling bug
	fix caused problems with auto-refresh, kept fix for projection
	activity (really this time)

	lissom_or_noshrinking with long range lateral connections with
	activity dependent strength - work in progress

	* examples/laminar.ty 1.34: current version of laminar - still a
	work in progress and also need to change name

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.38: removed conditions on loop in
	update_projectionactivity which was causing update of
	sheet_view_dict to be skipped, not sure why they were necessary,
	hopefully this hasn't broken anything else

2006-11-15  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/sullivan_neurocomputing04.ty 1.4, topo/base/cf.py 1.59,

	centers using CoordinateMapperFns

2006-11-15  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.63: changed activation count to include
	loop for when settling is turned off when measuring maps

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.37: added a parameter which must be
	set to determine wether or not settling is turned on when
	measuring maps (important for lissom sheets)

2006-11-14  r_primrose  <r_primrose@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.58: added commented out alternative receptive

	* topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py 1.7: Pressing return in a
	TaggedSlider can cause more actions than when it simply loses
	focus.

2006-11-14  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/rds.py 1.12: Removed special-purpose code for

	* examples/lissom_oo_od.ty 1.9: Added warning that this file has
	not yet been tested

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.86: Fixed bug -- Integer
	parameters like rds.random_seed were assigned TaggedSliders, but
	the TaggedSliders assume that the result is floating-point, and so
	dragging the slider did not work for such parameters

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.101: Made default orientation
	indicate that it is floating point

2006-11-14  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	keep, because they keep clogging up the cvs diff output and
	obscuring more important changes

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.50: Clarified documentation, as
	suggested by Chris Ball

2006-09-14  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.61: added state_push and pop which also
	ensure the correct iteration and settling step are saved

	* topo/base/simulation.py 1.44: rewrote state_push and pop to save
	state of all event processors and added event_push and pop which
	save only the event as before

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.40: renamed state_push and pop to
	event_push and pop in pattern_present - where these new functions
	save and reset the anly the simulation events as before (rather
	than the state), to ensure that a map can be calculated

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.49: now saves state before and
	re-instates after present_input_patterns
	inMeasureFeatureMap.measure_maps in order to reset settling count
	and simulation time properly during map measurment

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.87, topo/patterns/image.py 1.53: Moved
	PatternSampler from basic.py to image.py, where it is used

	* topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py 1.16: Minor cleanup

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.72, examples/lissom_or_sf.ty 1.25,

2006-08-17  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.33: changed cog to take projection
	as argument instead of sheet

2006-08-17  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.82: Removed obsolete comment

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.81: Simplified implementation of
	Composite by removing PatternSampler.  It does not currently
	support translation, rotation, etc. of the whole Composite, but
	those weren't working properly before either, and are easier to do
	without PatternSampler

2006-08-16  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.32: added argument to measure_cog
	function so that projections from a chosen sheet can be plotted

2006-08-16  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/about_text.php 1.2,
	doc/User_Manual/index_text.php 1.15,

2006-08-15  vldkr  <vldkr@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/homeo_lissom_or_noshrinking.ty 1.1: initial version

2006-08-15  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.31: Made changes to centre of
	gravity plotting

2006-08-14  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.56, topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.42: Changed
	output_activity argument name to mask to clarify what the data
	will be used for.  Made all CFPOFs respect the mask, for
	consistency.

	* topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py 1.13: Enabled some tests of
	composite patterns

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.80: Cleaned up comments and
	documentation

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.41: Re-enabled optimization that
	should now be safe again

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.55, topo/base/projection.py 1.82,
	topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.60: Changed name of apply_output_fn() to
	apply_learn_output_fn() to clarify that it is different from the
	activity output_fn.  (It's called learn_output_fn instead of
	weights_output_fn because the interface is specified at the
	ProjectionSheet level, and there is no concept of weights at that
	level, only learning.)  Made apply_learn_output_fn() accept an
	explicit mask so that it can be forced to apply to all units, and
	made all ones be passed in for the intial iteration for joint
	normalization.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.110: Added typedef for activity matrices,
	to encourage consistency.

	* examples/lissom_oo_od.ty 1.4: Changed input pattern definition
	to be a class so that it can be pickled.  Temporarily changed
	learning rates to match lissom_oo_or.ty.

2006-08-12  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.71: Changed ON and OFF channels to
	have a single DoG projection, instead of separate Center/Surround.
	Switched to joint normalization.  Changed default size of Gaussian
	for Test Pattern window.  Still needs parameter matching with the
	book simulations.

2006-08-11  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.40: Deleted an optimization that
	was causing problems for joint normalization

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.54: Changed __norm_total to _norm_total
	because hasattr() fails for names starting with a __ (due to name
	mangling)

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.59: Trivial improvement to comment

	* topo/misc/utils.py 1.22: Added handing for case where an array
	shape is an empty list; not sure why this would ever occur, but
	unpickling was failing until this was added

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.58: Removed division by length of joint
	normalization group

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.57: Added joint normalization for the
	first iteration

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.81: Added default learning method for
	all ProjectionSheets, to replace the one no longer in CFSheet

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.53, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.56: Moved methods
	related to joint normalization out of CFSheet and into
	JointNormalizingCFSheet (in lissom.py), so that only models using
	it will have to deal with that complexity.

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.39: Minor clarification

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.52: Replaced __normalize_joint_projections
	with __compute_joint_norm_totals, which only updates the
	norm_total property values, without actually doing any
	normalization

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.62, topo/outputfns/optimized.py
	1.38, topo/base/cf.py 1.51: Renamed ConnectionField.sum to
	ConnectionField.norm_total to emphasize that it is not necessarily
	always the sum.

	* examples/joublin_bc96.ty 1.10: Fixed missing import

	* examples/joublin_bc96.ty 1.9: Removed duplicate specification of
	weight_type, to ensure that it is consistent with cf.py

2006-08-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/reference/retina_lgn_match.ty 1.2: Initial version
	should have been like this.

	* topo/tests/reference/README.txt 1.1: Initial version.

	* topo/tests/reference/retina_lgn_match.ty 1.1: Script to help
	matching between c++ lissom and topographica.

2006-08-07  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.13: No longer in use

2006-08-04  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.37: Finished up the code for
	CFPOF_DivisiveNormalizeL1; mistakenly checked in earlier

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.49: Removed outdated comment

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.36: Added patch to get old pickled
	files to work

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.50, topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.61,
	topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.48, topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.35,
	topo/tests/testoutputfnsoptimized.py 1.7: Renamed _sum to __sum to
	make it private, and made all external code use sum instead.  This
	should prevent various problems found when _sum did not exist, due
	to mixing optimized and non-optimized components.  Removed use of
	cached values in DivisiveNormalizeL1, and instead supported that
	only in CFPOF_DivisiveNormalizeL1 to avoid problems when
	CFPOF_Plugin was used with anything but DivisiveNormalizeL1.
	Removed unused DivisiveNormalizeL1_opt.  The changes will affect
	the numerical value of each activation pattern, at the six or
	seventh decimal place total, due to using Numeric.sum in some
	cases and other sum routines in others.  This should also fix the
	various segfaults that were possible when mixing and matching
	optimized and non-optimized components.

	* doc/User_Manual/parameters_text.php 1.4: Fixed example

	* doc/Links/index_text.php 1.4: Fixed link

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.70: Made some parameters match those

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.44: Back to Composite for
	LGN weights, rather than separate projections.

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.49: Take the number of connections into
	account during joint normalization.

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.48: Fixed incorrect handling of cf.sum by
	CFPOF_Plugin; the problem ultimately comes from elsewhere,
	probably.

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.43: Changed size
	parameter of Gaussians for projections to LGN (to match the
	different definition of Gaussian in c++ lissom; c++ lissom divides
	by pi in the argument of exp in RadialFunction::Gaussian but not
	in retinalobjs).

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.42: Reverted to separate
	center and surround projections for debugging.

	it's present on windows.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.69: Added example of joint
	normalization

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.46: Replaced commented-out joint normalization
	code with enabled version using ports; still needs more cleanup

	* topo/base/simulation.py 1.43: Added _port_match method to allow
	the matching rule to be overridden by subclasses; should not have
	changed the behavior at all

2006-07-03  yschoe  <yschoe@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty 1.15, topo/base/cf.py 1.45,

	as the CPG itself.

	* topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py 1.12: Added new test for
	CompositePatternGenerator. Commented out at the moment because it
	fails.

	* topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py 1.11: Commented out a
	test. The test passes when run in isolation, but I didn't check it

	more obvious at which end they will be executed

	* etc/toporename 1.5: Fixed example usage

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.44: Changed to use a special

	to stop unnecessary looping.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.83: Some more simplification and
	restored an accidentally removed feature (right clicking on an
	object allows you to set parameters for the object being right
	clicked on).

	* topo/misc/utils.py 1.20: Changed dict_translator to eval in
	__main__.__dict__ rather than calling eval_atof(), which happens
	(wrongly) just to eval in __main__.__dict__. (Aiming at being able

	DivisiveNormalizeL1_opt.

2006-06-02  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.58, topo/outputfns/optimized.py
	1.30, topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.44: Cleaned up memory
	handling for PyObject calls from C code; reference counts were

	SLISSOM class. Use test pattern generator (gaussian) and
	repeatedly present the input to see the spiking.

	* examples/Makefile 1.9: Added som_retinotopy to standard examples
	to test with 'make all'

	* doc/Tutorials/som_retinotopy_text.php 1.5,
	examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.45: Made density be overridable from
	command line

	* topo/base/arrayutils.py 1.14, topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.42: At
	long last, fixed clip_in_place and related functions to use matrix
	operations for speed and so that they operate cleanly in place.

2006-05-31  yschoe  <yschoe@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.37, topo/responsefns/optimized.py
	1.43: Removed DynamicThreshold_CFPRF_DotProduct_opt class from
	responsefn.basic.  See sheets.slissom for the implementation of
	spiking.

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.36: Added hack alert. The stuff here
	needs to be removed or moved to optimized.py

	* examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty 1.10: Moved spiking mechanism from
	responsefn to sheet (new class SLISSOM).

	* topo/sheets/slissom.py 1.1: Spiking LISSOM sheet class,
	implementing dynamic thresholding. For leaky synapses, it needs
	the LeakyCFProjection class.

2006-05-31  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.84: Made auto-refresh update the
	actual windows also, so that it takes effect immediately even when
	called from a script.  Also made load_snapshot do an
	auto_refresh() to update any windows that have auto-refresh
	enabled.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.45, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py
	1.83: Greatly simplified display of the activity patterns during
	map measurement, and now left it uncommented by default.

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.26: Increased size of default
	pattern for position preference measurement so that it would be
	more likely to activate all neurons; typically improves quality of
	position preference map.

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.42: Removed redundant class

	* examples/homeostatic.ty 1.19: Fixed thresholds to be applied
	even on the first call, used Numeric.sum() for averaging, and
	allowed bounds to be controlled by parameters.

	* examples/homeostatic.ty 1.18: Updated with Veldri's changes:
	simple example of adjusting threshold based on the average value
	in a rectangular window.  Reduced LGNOn density to make debugging

	function.

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.35: Added
	DynamicThreshold_CFPRF_DotProduct_opt, a CFPRF_DotProduct_opt with
	dynamic thresholding. Right now, it only has a fixed threshold. It
	uses the optimized __call__ in its parent, while the thresholding
	part is plain Python code.

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.39: Added a "primitive" Spike output
	function.

2006-05-29  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.93: Removed a task.

	* topo/tests/testoutputfnsoptimized.py 1.3: Reduced precision of a
	test because Numeric sticks with the Float32s.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.47: The sharedcf has its weights
	pattern centered on the src sheet, not the dest shee.

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.27: Just save the center unit's xcenter and
	ycenter as attributes that can be used later. This will be cleaned
	up.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.77, topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py
	1.36: Shows balloon help for object over the title.

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.24: Added more text to HACKALERT.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.92: Added some tasks.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.76: Checkbuttons are aligned on

	readonly Entry.

	* topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.20: Removed font specification
	for read-only entry text.

2006-05-23  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	1.85, topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.22,
	topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.81: Changed balloon help to use

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.45: Added doc string to name

	* etc/replaceall 1.2: Minor note

2006-05-22  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/cf.py 1.24: CFProjection creates a slice_template and
	passes it to each CF, rather than each CF creating its own
	slice. Reduces lissom_or.ty's startup time to about 80% of its
	previous value.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.44: SharedWeightCFProjection
	initializes its sharedcf to have x and y 'on the grid' -
	previously it just set them both to 0.

2006-05-22  yschoe  <yschoe@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/leaky_lissom_or.ty 1.1: Added leaky_lissom_or.ty to the
	source tree. This is a copy of lissom_or.ty with the afferent
	connections turned into LeakyCFProjection. The lissom_or.ty file
	will be periodically copied to leaky_lissom_or.ty and minor edits
	made, to keep future developments in lissom_or.ty independent of
	leaky_lissom_or.ty.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.82: Added "kill" hotkey for plot
	windows (Control-q).

2006-05-22  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* etc/toporename 1.1: Initial version

2006-05-22  yschoe  <yschoe@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.43: Fixed bug in LeakyCFProjection,
	and initialized leaky_input_activity to a zero matrix.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.42: Added activate() for
	LeakyCFProjection. A finer time-scale needs to be implemented.

2006-05-22  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.30: Uses Numeric's sum().

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.21: Uses Numeric's sum instead of
	Python's. This has a big impact on the performance. Starting
	lissom_or (which uses DivisiveSumNormalize_opt1 many times), this
	gives a the startup time 65% of the previous time.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.79: Shell prints new prompt
	everytime the simulation is run, as it did before. Otherwise the
	prompt does not appear again after messages are printed.

2006-05-21  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testtopoconsole.py 1.4: Removed test that didn't have
	much use.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.75: Changed 'run for' slider.

	* topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py 1.4: Added facility to set
	slider_width to TaggedSlider.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.74: Stopped shell printing a new
	prompt after every run command from the GUI.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.73: Added '>>>' label to command
	prompt.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.72: 'run for' displays 1.0
	initially. 'commands' not displayed by default.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.71: 'Run for' is a
	TaggedSlider. String format needs to be adjusted, and pressing
	enter should make the simulation run too.

	* topo/tkgui/translatorwidgets.py 1.3: TaggedSlider seems to
	assume a method optional_refresh() will always exist on its
	parent; I put in a try/catch but the whole thing (still) needs to
	be reviewed.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.70: Corrected variable name.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.69: Altered 'run simulation for
	group'. Changed how 'commands' group is hidden. There are still
	some problems: width changes, not enough padding in places.

2006-05-21  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.31: Removed debugging print
	statement

2006-05-21  yschoe  <yschoe@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.41: LeakyCFProjection class added
	(just a place holder, for now).

2006-05-21  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.68: Added code to demonstrate
	showing/hiding the commands box.

	* etc/pipecap 1.1, etc/replaceall 1.1: Initial version

	top of console.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.63: Corrected mistake.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.62: Command output text is not
	editable.

	finished and I try to do it continuously anyway.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.85: Removed a task.

	* doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php 1.8: No need to re-run the

	bounds in its bounds attribute, not a true_bounds attribute. Sheet
	has Parameters nominal_density and nominal_bounds; these are what
	gets set by users of Sheet. Because Sheet is a
	SheetCoordinateSystem, it has its true bounds in its bounds
	attribute, and its true density in its xdensity or ydensity
	attributes (because for a Sheet xdensity=ydensity).

	* topo/tests/testlissom_cpointer.ty 1.5: Removed test of
	non-existent classes.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.78: Added tasks. Fixed typos.

	* topo/base/simulation.py 1.33: added commented-out code for
	ensuring all out_connections have a unique name.

	* topo/sheets/composer.py 1.15: Made call to EP's _connect_from in
	a more obvious way.

	simulation, if one with the same name already exists, it's
	overwritten.

	* topo/base/simulation.py 1.29: EPs can be deleted from the
	simulation.

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.30: Removed my HACKALERT about

	it is.

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.29: Corrected my previous-but-one
	checkin for iterating through out_connections.

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.28: Added HACKALERT.

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.24: Removed HACKALERT that no longer
	applies (cog plot for SharedWeightCFProjection is a regular grid).

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.23: Made measure_cog only be called
	for CFSheets, rather than for all ProjectionSheets.

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.22: Removed hackalert that doesn't
	apply since the previous commit.

	* topo/base/simulation.py 1.27: Changed time to a 4
	d.p. (FixedPoint) number.

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.48: Made input pattern
	properties be set on an object, rather than on the whole Gaussian
	class.

	* topo/base/simulation.py 1.26: Re-enabled the repr method of
	EPConnectionEvent, now that ParameterizedObject's
	get_param_values() does not generate a new DynamicNumber.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.43: Added a hack to
	get_param_values to avoid generating new DynamicNumbers.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.41: Added 'last_value' to
	DynamicNumber, for storing the last value that was generated.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.42: Simplified
	get_param_values(); I think it still does the same thing.

	* topo/base/simulation.py 1.25: Commented out EPConnectionEvent's
	repr method, because it was causing new DynamicNumbers to be
	generated. Added HACKALERT.

	topo/base/simulation.py 1.23: Changed Simulation.run() to complete

	time.  Shouldn't affect any long-term simulation results, but
	scripts have to change GeneratorSheet.phase to be nonzero so that
	the plots make sense at even multiples of the period

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.33: Uses c++ shared
	weight response function.

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.29: Added
	SharedWeightCFPDotProduct_opt1, as a speedier replacement for
	SharedWeightCFPResponseFn(single_cf_fn=Mdot()). Also added
	untested DotProduct_op1, Mdot in C++; it's not used anywhere, we
	might just remove it.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.39: SharedWeightCFProjection needs
	to wrap its cfs list in a better way, so we don't need separate
	response fns etc. But for now, I've done this enough to allow a
	C++ replacement of the shared weight response fn, which we badly
	need to improve performance.

	We were able to recover them by checking in our CVS digest
	messages one by one, but the ChangeLog file from here forward for
	about a week may have some duplication with the data from here
	backward for about a week.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.67: Removed some commented-out
	code about DynamicNumber. If DynamicNumbers display strangely in
	ParametersFrames, then it might be because I commented out this
	code before - so it may be necessary to restore it. For now,
	though, I don't remember what it was for.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.66: Tidied imports.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.65: Minor cleanup, with some

	1.36: Improved TestPattern so that the reduce, enlarge and
	sheetcoords buttons are working. There is still a problem
	remaining for the integerscaling button: when it is on, and that
	we try to reduce, we obtain a Division by Zero error.

2006-05-03  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	functions around that were defined in __main__, since the source
	won't be found on unpickling.

2006-04-30  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.47: Updated a task.

	* examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.29: Input pattern parameters are
	set on a Gaussian object rather than on the Gaussian class.

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.29: Added a HACKALERT about the
	input_generator bounds.

	* examples/tiny.ty 1.8: Uses RandomWrapper with separate seed for
	each stream of number. Minor tidy.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.83: Changed to use topo.sim['V1']-style
	access to simulator. Scheduled actions changed to strings.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.82: Finished previous minor cleanup.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.81: Minor cleanup. Removed commented-out
	code (it was confusing).

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.70: Corrected mistake in Composite; now
	works again for weights generation.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.42: Removed erroneous
	statement in one of the tasks.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.178: Changed
	CFProjection.initialize_bounds() so that it avoids floating-point
	representation difficulties. Specifically, it uses bounds2slice()
	to get the right and bottom values of the slice, then mirrors
	these about the center of the slice to get the left and top values
	- ensuring the slice is odd. Updated CF.offset_bounds() so that it
	does not assume the bounds it receives are centered at (0,0) on
	the Sheet. These alterations could affect the behaviour of
	existing networks; the reference simulations show no change.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.95: Made set_slice be available outside the
	Slice class, temporarily.

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.25: Added method to BoundingBox

	bounds2slice() that fails because of the floating point
	representation of these particular bounds.

	weights matrix ends up with a zero-sized dimension.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.176: Added assert statement

	* topo/misc/numbergenerators.py 1.4: Renamed
	RandomDistributionWrapper to RandomDistribution. Removed a
	HACKALERT.

2006-04-27  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testsimulator.py 1.5: Updated test with new class
	name.

	Adds a command to the simulator's startup_commands.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.55, topo/commands/basic.py 1.30: Added
	startup_commands Parameter to Simulator. Altered
	topo.commands.basic's save_snapshot() and load_snapshot() so that
	these commands are executed before the simulator is unpickled. Now
	scheduled actions can be pickled and unpickled without difficulty.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.32: Added a task about
	correcting things causing pickling to fail. Added task about
	adding a set of more in-depth tests, distinct from the
	quick-to-run tests.

	instead of schedule_action().

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.54: Added more helpful printing in the
	case of a SyntaxError for CommandEvent.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.53: Added Event class, and EPEvent and
	CommandEvent subclasses (as well as SAEVent class which will be
	removed when all uses of schedule_action() in the examples are
	removed). There is one change to the logic in Simulator.run(): now
	did_event is set to True no matter what type of Event is called
	(rather than just for SimulatorEvents without 'fn' attribute, as
	before). I don't think this affects the behaviour.

	there is no longer any need to override the superclass's
	version.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.165: Removed another print
	statement that I left in by mistake.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.25: SharedWeight's cf(r,c)

	started to put them in some kind of order (in which I'm doing
	them).

	CoordinateTransformer, rather than from a Slice. Removed Slice
	from imports.

	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.76: Added a method
	restore_environment in PlotGroup panel to restore the
	state of the buttons when reloading a Plotgroup from the
	history.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.75: Corrected the handling of
	the history so that it act properly when hitting refresh or
	auto-refresh.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.74: Corrected the saving of
	the history so that we do not update a PlotGroup in the past.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.73,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.54,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.18,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.119,
	topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.17: Changed the handling
	of the history: now a copy of the plotgroup is kept in history
	instead of bitmaps. It still needs more work.

2006-04-20 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.87: Simplified code committed in the
	last version.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.37: Where xdensity==ydensity,
	CoordinateTransformers are created by passing just one
	density.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.86: Can create a CoordinateTransformer
	by specifying only one density if xdensity==ydensity.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.26: Updated my tasks.

	* topo/tests/testimage.py 1.6,
	topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py 1.9: Uses xdensity and
	ydensity in the tests, rather than just density. Only tests
	cases where they're equal, though.

	* topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.20, topo/tests/testsheetview.py
	1.12: Commented out the ImageGenerator class. Tests using it
	will be resurrected in an equivalent form using the Image
	class.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.36: Updated after changes to
	sheet.py (introduction of CoordinateTransformer). Some further
	changes will be required when CoordinateTransformer is changed
	some more...

	* topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.19,
	topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py 1.15: Removed unused import
	statement.

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.28: The image generator is
	passed xdensity and ydensity (both equal, since for a sheet
	these are equal).

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.96: Uses Slice and
	* CoordinateTransformer.

	* topo/patterns/random.py 1.24: Uses xdensity and ydensity,
	and the Slice object.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.50: Uses xdensity and ydensity.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.69: PatternSampler uses xdensity
	and ydensity. This is an intermediate checkin - needs to be
	cleaned up.

	* topo/learningfns/som.py 1.4: Uses xdensity and ydensity in
	call to pattern generator.

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.16: Calls matrix2sheet() as a
	method of the sheet being considered.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.83: Part-way checkin. Uses
	the Slice object, but more of the calculations in
	PatternGenerator will move to the Slice object.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.163: Uses the Slice and
	CoordinateTransformer classes. Some of the calculations in
	here will move to the Slice object (e.g. translation of a
	slice).

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.85: Part-way checkin. Created
	CoordinateTransformer class, which contains methods that were
	previously coordinate-transforming functions in this
	file. Updated the Slice object. Still have to move some
	methods from CoordinateTransformer to Slice, and finalize
	other aspects.

2006-04-19 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.118,
	topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.16,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.53: Deleted the attribute
	sheet_filter_lam of a PlotGroup in order to be able to deep
	copy a PlotGroup.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.117,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.72,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.52: Corrected the
	_set_height_of_tallest_plot and the scale_images method for a
	ProjectionPlotGroup.

2006-04-19 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.68: Replaced the untested
	CompositePatternGenerator with a new, untested
	CompositePatternGenerator. This one is simpler.

2006-04-19 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.71,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.51: Added a parameter update
	when calling display_plots (determines whether to regenerate
	the SheetViews).

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.116: Minor change in doc and
	comment.

2006-04-19 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.15: Get cf.slice_array rather
	than calling cf.slice_tuple(). (This was part of an earlier
	change, but does not seem to have been committed.)

2006-04-18 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.27: Removed unnecessary
	setting of bounds and density. Removed out of date HACKALERT.

2006-04-15 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py 1.8: File is now a
	reasonable test of PatternGenerator.

	* topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py 1.7: Added more tests.

	* topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py 1.6: Updated test.

	* topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py 1.5: Changed the test so
	that it actually does what was intended (previously the
	'assert' statement was not testing anything about the
	arrays). Currently it fails but this might be because the test
	itself is wrong.

2006-04-14 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.24, topo/responsefns/projfns.py
	1.3, topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.162: Removed cf's
	slice_tuple() method. Going to rename slice_array to
	slice_. slice_ being an array does not make it awkward to
	access the elements since Python automatically unpacks array
	values anyway.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.84: Removed an outdated HACKALERT.

2006-04-14 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.115: Minor re-organization;
	deleted self.bitmaps.

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.33, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.114, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.70,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.50: Delete the attribute
	plot_src_name and name for a Bitmap (Not needed
	anymore). Delete the PlotGroup load_images method; now we
	explicitly built the bitmap list in PlotGroupPanel
	display_plots().

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.95, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.113, topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.15,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.69: Moved the generation of the
	plot labels to PlotGroup; it will enable getting rid of the
	copy of plot_src_name and name from Plot to Bitmap, and
	eventually getting rid of the direct use of Bitmaps objects.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.68: Re-organized order in the
	file, added alert.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.67: Deleted unused import
	statements.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.66: Temporary hack to fix
	back and forward buttons.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.65: Minor re-organization of
	the __init__ method.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.64,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.17: Added a second
	control frame for Back, Forward, Sheetcoordinates and
	Integerscaling Buttons. Moved the Sheetcoords button from
	templateplotgrouppanel to plotgrouppanel. Deleted old
	comments.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.63: Deleted the
	scale_images() method in PlotGroupPanel. Now the scaling is
	done within PlotGroup. Also deleted unused import statements
	and old alerts and update doc.

2006-04-13 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.112: Added two ALERTS.

2006-04-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.82: No visible change -
	minor alteration to the code.

2006-04-13 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.111,
	topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.14,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.62,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.49,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.16,
	topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.30: Deleted the attribute
	plotgroup_key of a PlotGroup.

2006-04-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.161: Get sheet's shape from
	sheet's activity matrix shape.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.160: Use sheet methods
	bounds2slice() and slice2bounds().

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.83: Added sheet methods bounds2slice()
	and slice2bounds().

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.82: Minor changes to documentation.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.81: Enforce minimum number of units in
	each direction to be 1; rename slice variable to slice_;
	changes to documentation.

2006-04-13 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.110: Deleted two unused import
	statement.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.109: Got rid of the use of
	dict_sort. Now the ordering of the plot is performed
	differently.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.108: Deleted the import
	statement for flatten and change the code that was using it.

2006-04-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.80: Small change to documentation.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.79: No visible change - small tidy up.

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.24: Minor change to
	documentation.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.36: Moved __doc__
	definition higher up in the Parameter class so it is a bit
	more obvious. Added check that subclasses of Parameter define
	__slots__.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.48: Added __slots__ and __doc__ to
	EventProcessorParameter.

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.23: Added __slots__ and
	__doc__ to BoundingRegionParameter.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.78: Updated Sheet documentation a bit.

2006-04-13 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.107,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.15: Replaced the import
	statement for the commands within templateplotgrouppanel, and
	import them in __main__.__dict__. They also are executed in
	__main__.__dict__ from the PlotGroups.

2006-04-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.77: Removed unused functions
	slicearray2bounds() and bounds2slicearray(). All slices will
	be arrays eventually, but for now they are Python tuples.

2006-04-13 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.106: Deleted unused import
	statements.

2006-04-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.67: Removed xdensity and ydensity
	from current Composite class (which will be replaced anyway).

2006-04-13 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.29,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.105,
	topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.13,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.61,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.48,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.14,
	topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.29: Deleted the plotgroup_dict
	variable: now each panel creates and stores its own plotgroup
	attribute and uses it accordingly. Added a method
	generate_sheet_views to the PlotGroups: now the command to
	update the sheet view is contained in PlotGroups (and still
	can be modified from the panel). This is the first version
	without plotgroup_dict; it needs some cleaning and improving
	(in particular for the projectionpanel and testpattern).

2006-04-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.76, topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.35:
	Removed xdensity and ydensity. Except in the documentation.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.75, topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.34:
	slice2bounds() does not use xdensity and ydensity.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.74, topo/commands/analysis.py 1.14,
	topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.33: matrix2sheet() does not use
	xdensity and ydensity.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.73, topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.32:
	sheet2matrix() and sheet2matrixidx() don't use xdensity and
	ydensity.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.31: Altered a test; no visible
	change.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.30: Uncommented a test case that
	I'd previously left commented out by mistake.

2006-04-12 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.72: crop_slice_to_sheet() doesn't use
	xdensity and ydensity.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.94: Removed unused import.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.71: submatrix() just takes density.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.70, topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.29:
	bounds2slice() just uses density, not xdensity and ydensity.

	* topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py 1.14: Only one line was in
	the test, so I commented that one too.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.93: Removed xdensity and
	ydensity. Adjusted the corresponding HACKALERT.

	* topo/base/functionfamilies.py 1.1: Initial version.

	* topo/learningfns/som.py 1.3, topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.28,
	topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.14, topo/patterns/basic.py 1.66,
	topo/patterns/image.py 1.49, topo/patterns/random.py 1.23,
	topo/projections/basic.py 1.23, topo/tests/testimage.py 1.5,
	topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.159,
	topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.81, topo/base/projection.py
	1.64: Moved OutputFn, OutputFnParameter, and Identity to
	functionfamilies (from projection). Renamed Identity to
	IdentityOF.

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.32: Import the basic response
	functions.

	* topo/responsefns/projfns.py 1.2: Removed unnecessary
	__init__()s. Use ResponseFnParameter for single_cf_fn.

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.22: Removed unnecessary
	__init__(). Use ResponseFnParameter.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.22: Use ResponseFnParameter.

	* topo/base/arrayutils.py 1.7, topo/base/connectionfield.py
	1.158: Moved Mdot() to connectionfield.py and made it a
	LearningFn. Made ResponseFnParameter.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.157: Changed a sum() of the
	weights to Numeric.sum(). Numeric.sum() is faster. (Python's
	sum() and Numeric's sum() appear to give slightly different
	results in general, though this particular change makes no
	difference at the moment.)

2006-04-12 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.104: Minor re-organization of
	the __init__.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.60,
	topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.28,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.103,
	topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.12,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.47,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.13: Renamed
	plot_group_key to plotgroup_key for consistency.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.102,
	topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.11,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.59,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.46,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.12,
	topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.28: Added arguments sheetcoords
	and integersaling to the PlotGroup constructor. Renamed
	plotgroup() to refresh_plotgroup() in PlotGroupPanel and
	subclasses. Now, refresh_plotgroup() is only called from the
	refresh method, and I added an attribute self.plotgroup that
	stores the current PlotGroup. Also deleted old code in
	PlotGroupPanel.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.101: Deleted old comments;
	improved two lines of code.

2006-04-12 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.24: Updated a task.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.23: Updated my tasks.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.156: Removed xdensity and
	ydensity, just using density now.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.69: Intermediate checkin. Removing
	xdensity and ydensity gradually.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.80, topo/patterns/random.py
	1.22: PatternGenerators only accept density as a single
	number.

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.26: Only passes density, not
	xdensity and ydensity, to PatternGenerator for creating the
	input pattern.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.28: Removed test of bounds2slice()
	that deliberately uses different x and y densities.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.27: Added a test for Sheet
	creation where the specified bounds and density would not give
	a sheet with the same density along x as along y.

2006-04-11 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.92: Changed a HACKALERT.

2006-04-11 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.32, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.91:
	Got rid of the attribute resize for the bitmap, and added it
	to Plot objects.

	* topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py 1.13,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.100,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.45,
	topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.10,
	topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.27, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py
	1.58, topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.11: Moved
	everything not special to the GUI from PlotGroupPanel to
	PlotGroup (e.g. sale_images,
	_set_height_of_tallest_plot). Also deleted the old
	do_plot_cmd, by a plotgroup() method that regenrates the
	PlotGroup anytime from the panels. It is a first version that
	have been committed in order to be further simplified. Note
	also that there is a slight bug for the ProjectionPanel and
	for the handling of the SheetCoordinates check_button, but
	this will be fixed very soon.

2006-04-11 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.68: Sheet has same density in x and y
	directions (by adjusting height of BoundingBox if
	necessary. Intermediate checkin: still have to removed
	xdensity and ydensity from the code, and update the
	documentation.

	* examples/Makefile 1.8: Sets default_density to be smaller
	before running each example.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.79, examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.35,
	examples/hierarchical.ty 1.41, examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.38:
	Allowed cortical density to be set externally via
	default_density variable (otherwise uses the value set in the
	file).

2006-04-11 alan_lindsay <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.26, topo/tkgui/editortools.py
	1.12, topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.24: Colours of sheets
	changed (together) by setting the canvas' mode. No lateral
	button in sheet's property panel, just a list of connections
	(opens their properties). Auto refresh and normalize options
	in the canvas.

	* doc/User_Manual/images/editorconnectiondrag.png 1.1,
	doc/User_Manual/images/editorproperties.png 1.1,
	doc/User_Manual/images/editorrepresentations.png 1.1,
	doc/User_Manual/images/editortoolbaritems.png 1.1,
	doc/User_Manual/model_editor.html 1.1: First draft user guide
	for the model editor. Does not link to other sections and does
	not conform to the style of the other pages.

2006-04-11 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.26: Fix by Chris -- override
	default Sheet bounds and density to be sure it's the ones we
	expect

	* .cvsignore 1.8: Added missing newline

2006-04-11 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.31: Removed projection-level
	response functions (they are in projfns.py.

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.21: Updated
	CFProjectionResponseFn imports to be from projfns.

	* topo/responsefns/projfns.py 1.1: Renamed basic.py to
	projfns.py since it contains only projection-level response
	functions.

2006-04-10 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.25: Re-enabled a test that I
	disabled. This version, revision 1.25, is identical to
	revision 1.23. I disabled the test when I changed how the
	tests are run, because it began failing with no change other
	than the test-running mechanism (and had not been failing
	before). As far as I could tell, the test was running properly
	and not failing before I changed the testing mechanism, so I
	decided to comment out the test and investigate later on. I am
	re-enabling the test because it is legitimately failing. I'm
	not sure what is going on: was it not running before? How
	could it not have been failing? The functions it is testing
	have not changed throughout this process, so I am
	confused. Maybe we all had *.pyc files left that were not
	updated, though that seems unlikely.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.65: Added commented-out new version
	of CompositePatternGenerator. Corrected import statements
	(including for when new CompositePatternGenerator is
	uncommented.

2006-04-08 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.22: Updated my tasks.

	* examples/tiny.ty 1.7, topo/learningfns/__init__.py 1.6,

	and projfns.

	* topo/learningfns/projfns.py 1.1: Initial version.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.155: Removed HACKALERT.

	Attempting to organize functions that iterate over the CFs of
	a CFProjection and those that act on a single array.

	(As part of the more general idea that there are e.g. output
	functions which apply to a Projection.)

	For output functions, we have the single-array (normal
	mathematical) output functions, e.g.: OutputFn Identity
	DivisiveSumNormalize We also have the functions that iterate
	through a CFProjection's CFs, applying an OutputFn to each:
	CFProjectionOuputFn
	CFProjectionIdentityOutputFn(single_cf_fn=Identity())
	CFProjectionDivisiveSumNormalize(single_cf_fn=DivisiveSumNormalize())

	OutputFns are in topo.outputfns.basic, and
	CFProjectionOutputFns are in topo.outputfns.projfns. Other
	Projection-level output functions would also go in the projfns
	module.

	The same applies to LearningFns and
	CFProjectionLearningFns. ResponseFunctions have been renamed
	CFProjectionResponseFunctions where they apply to a
	CFProjection. The reorganization of LearningFns and
	ResponseFns is not complete yet.

	Along with this reorganization, CFProjectionOutputFnParameter
	(as distinct from OutputFnParameter) has been introduced (and
	similarly for LearningFns). Implementation of these is not
	complete yet; notably the __init__.py files in the outputfns,
	learningfns, and responsefns packages need to be cleaned up.

	In addition to this, minor cleanups may also have occurred,
	including: skipping calls to __init__() methods if all they do
	is call the superclass' __init__()s; documentation strings.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.37: Updated documentation
	for ClassSelectorParameter.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.153: Added
	CFOutputFunctionParameter class; made weights_output_fn be a
	CFOutputFunctionParameter.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.152: GenericCFOF: removed
	__init__() method, since it does nothing but call the
	superclass'. Made single_cf_fn parameter be an
	OutputFunctionParameter.

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.62: Minor clean-up of comments.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.151: CFOutputFunction is
	abstract.

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.12: Updated docstring.

	* topo/outputfns/projfns.py 1.1: Initial version.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.21: Updated my tasks.

	* topo/misc/utils.py 1.5: No visible change, altered syntax.

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.28, topo/misc/utils.py 1.4: Minor
	changes to pickling - should be no visible change.

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.14: Allowed a test to be ignored
	easily. Removed testsnapshots from the automatic tests.

	* topo/tests/testsnapshots.py 1.1: Initial version.

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.13: Added ability to run a specific
	list of test modules.

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.27: Updated docstrings for save_
	and load_snapshot

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.26: When being pickled, the
	simulator has its RELEASE attribute set to topo.release.

	* topo/tests/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py 1.2: Added missing
	import statement.

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.12: Updated doc string, added ALERT
	about structure of tests/ directory that we might consider in
	the future.

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.11, topo/tests/testmatplotlibtk.py
	1.1, topo/tests/testplotgrouppanel.py 1.1,
	topo/tests/testpropertiesframe.py 1.1,

	* topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.19,
	topo/tests/testpatternpresent.py 1.9,
	topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py 1.12: Reduced sheet densities.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.43, topo/commands/analysis.py
	1.13: Removed calls to active_sim() and some passing round of
	simulators.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.42: Removed a HACKALERT and
	the corresponding call to active_sim().

	* topo/tests/testfeaturemap.py 1.13: Reduced density of sheets
	in test_measurefeaturemap(). It runs a lot faster now.

2006-04-07 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.18: Deleted
	cfsheetplotpanel.py: the code is now in both connectionfield
	and projection panels.

	* topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.44: Added the code of
	cfsheetplotpanel in projectionpanel and made it inherit from
	TemplatePlotGroupPanel instead

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.10: Modified the
	__init__ method: call refresh only if it is an instance of
	TemplatePlotGroupPanel. Allow calling the constructor for
	subclasses.

	* topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.9: Added the code of
	cfsheetplotpanel in connectionfieldpanel and made it inherit
	from TemplatePlotGroupPanel instead

2006-04-07 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.20: Updated my tasks.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.47: Removed TopoImage, which I
	forgot to do on the previous commit.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.46: Removed the TopoImage class and
	a related HACKALERT. Images are now loaded only once, rather
	than every time Image's function() is called.

2006-04-07 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.17: temporary hack to get
	the normalize button set properly for a connectionfieldspanel
	and a projectionpanel. It will be properly sorted when getting
	rid of CFSheetPlotPanel and correcting the hierarchy of the
	panels.

2006-04-07 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.45: Added HACKALERT.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.64, topo/patterns/image.py 1.44:
	Corrected mistake in PatternSampler where background value was
	being calculated before array was normalized.

2006-04-07 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.57,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.43: Renamed
	_set_initial_master_zoom to _set_height_of_tallest_plot.

	* topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.42: Corrected
	self.zoom_factor to be self.height_of_tallest_plot and
	INITIAL_PLOT_WIDTH to INITIAL_PLOT_HEIGHT. Added a
	re-implementation of the _set_initial_master_zoom for the
	projectionpanel (but it needs more work).

2006-04-07 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.63, topo/patterns/image.py 1.43:
	Moved PatternSampler class from topo/patterns/image.py to
	topo/patterns/basic.py in anticipation of using it for
	Composite. This might not be the correct final location for
	PatternSampler.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.42: Created a new class,
	PatternSampler, which does the sampling of a pattern that
	TopoImage did previously. TopoImage is now a subclass of
	PatternSampler.

2006-04-07 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.16: Corrected error in
	cfsheetplotpanel (forgot to change the name of
	self.zoom_factor to self.height_of_tallest_plot and
	self.min_zoom_factor to self.min_master_zoom); that should fix
	the connectionfieldpanel.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.56: Replaced self.master_zoom
	by self.height_of_tallest_plot.

2006-04-07 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.10: Any file named test*.py that
	defines the 'suite' attribute will be included when the tests
	are run.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.24: Commented out a test which is
	out of date. Will be updated when sheet.py and
	connectionfield.py are reviewed.

2006-04-06 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.55: simplified the function
	_set_initial_plot_zoom; now there is only one
	master_zoom. Deleted the function _compute_max_height.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.54: Corrected the function
	scale image; renamed self.min_zoom_factor to
	self.min_master_zoom.

2006-04-06 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* .cvsignore 1.7: Added 'topographica.bat' (which exists after
	installation on Windows).

	* topo/tests/testimage.py 1.4: Added more tests.

2006-04-06 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.53: Implement a master_zoom
	for both sheet coordinates and matrix coordinates.

2006-04-06 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.41: User-specified numbers involved
	in divisions are first turned to floats in case integer values
	are specified.

	* topo/tests/testimage.py 1.3: Altered HACKALERT.

2006-04-05 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.9: testimage.py added to the list
	of tests. Currently one test is failing, because of a mistake
	in image.py version 1.40; this will be corrected in the next
	version of image.py.

	* topo/tests/testimage.py 1.2: Continued writing.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.62: Removed an out-of-date
	HACKALERT.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.61: Altered a HACKALERT.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.40: Size scaling of each of the
	image dimensions is done relative to the default retinal
	dimension of 1.0, rather than the current sheet's dimension.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.39: Corrected typo in
	documentation.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.38: Changed previous output_fn to
	'whole_image_output_fn (needs a better name), so that there
	can also be an output_fn to apply to the section of image that
	is actually displayed (i.e. the meaning of output_fn for other
	PatternGenerators).

	* topo/patterns/random.py 1.21: Added output_fn to
	PatternGenerators in random.py. Switched order of import
	statements.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.78: Added output_fn to
	Constant.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.77: PatternGenerators have
	an OutputFunctionParameter.

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.61: OutputFunction is an abstract
	class.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.76: Corrected test for
	whether or not an argument supplied to __call__() is a
	Parameter. Added commented-out code for an output_fn on
	PatternGenerator (so this change is separate from the first
	one).

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.75: Updated some
	documentation.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.74: Added a warning to
	__call__() of PatternGenerator if a value is passed for
	something that does not exist as a Parameter.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.73: No visible change, just
	switched order of import statements.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.72: Allowed to specifiy
	scale and offset when calling PatternGenerator (altered
	ConstantGenerator in the same way).

	* topo/tests/testimage.pgm 1.2: Changed to have one even
	dimension and one odd dimension.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.37: Simplified the TopoImage class
	by using a Sheet as the container for an image. That way,
	coordinate transforms can work using the standard sheet.py
	functions. Also, altered how the initial image scaling works
	(it remains to make the initial scaling relative to the
	default 1.0 retinal area, rather than the current retina).

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.67: Added a version of
	sheet2matrixidx() that works for arrays. (All these functions
	still have to be cleaned up into the Slice class.)

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.22: Added
	contains_exclusive(), which is the same as contains() except
	the right and bottom boundaries of the BoundingBox are
	considered exclusive.

2006-04-05 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* ChangeLog.txt 1.4: Updated with recent changes

2006-04-05 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.60: Added 'sum' argument to
	Identity.

	* topo/tests/testimage.py 1.1, topo/tests/utils.py 1.1:
	Initial version.

	* topo/tests/testimage.pgm 1.1: An image to use for testing
	the image generator in image.py.

2006-03-29  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.52: Started to re-write
	scale_images: got rid of the arbitrary factor 10 in the case of
	sheet coordinate scaling; now the largest bitmap is scaled to
	INITIAL_PLOT_HEIGHT in any cases. It remains to implement a master
	zoom for each case.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.99,
	topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.8: Corrected label display
	for connection field panel accordingly to the new changes in the
	UnitView plot_src_name attribute.

	* topo/base/sheetview.py 1.14: Made the plot_src_name attribute
	be set to the src sheet name for a UnitView as well, (it is a
	necessary step in order to implement the sheet coordinates button
	for the connection field panel).

2006-03-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.20: Removed a line (unused) that I
	left in by accident one time.

2006-03-29  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.51: Made Integer scaling button
	refresh automatically

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.98: Fixed typo in comment

2006-03-28  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.50: Corrected mistake in
	toogle_normalize (without a call to scale_images, the Plots are not
	regenerated.)

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.9: Set the attribute
	normalize according to the value for the template (for a
	TemplatePlotGroupPanel).

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.26: Corrected Plot creation in the
	TestPattern, according to the new changes in Plot.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.97, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.90: Got
	rid of the situate argument for plot: now it is all determined by
	the plot_bounding_box.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.89, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.96,
	topo/tests/testplot.py 1.19: Changed Plot: now that UnitViews
	shared the same bounds as the SheetViews, there is no need to
	slice anymore when combining SheetViews with UnitViews. Now, a
	plot_bounding_box is specified, in which the plot is drawn, or the
	bounds of the Sheet are taken if no plot_bounding_box are
	specified. There is still some problems for some plot_bounding_box
	and density values combinations that will have to be adressed, but
	no current used feature is broken.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.150: Made UnitView bounds the
	same as the source Sheet bounds of the connectionfield; therefore,
	all SheetViews from a Sheet have the same bounds.

2006-03-27  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.7,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.49, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py
	1.41, topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.8: Changed
	PlotGroupPanel to keep track of the plot_time of the current plot,
	which may differ from the current simulator time; this makes the
	back and forward buttons work with all PlotGroupPanels.  Cleaned
	up implementation of back and forward in general.

	* examples/tiny.ty 1.5: Made it more obvious that the
	learning_rate is a float

2006-03-27  judelaw  <judelaw@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.48: Added back and forward
	buttons - only really currently working well for activity window

2006-03-27  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.149: Fixed bug -- if users
	specified the learning rate as an integer, it was being truncated
	to an even multiple of the size of the CF, with surprising
	results.  Now effectively promotes the rate to a float.

2006-03-27  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.59: Removed print statements
	accidentally left in the previous version.

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.58: Altered wording of an error
	message.

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.57: Updated documentation for
	present_input(). Also renamed uses of the 'dest_port' variable
	name to just 'port' within the ProjectionSheet code; before it was
	confusing. The Projection has the dest_port and src_port concept
	(referring to src and dest EPs), but for a ProjectionSheet should
	it be more like 'in_port' and 'out_port'?

2006-03-27  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.51: Added ALERT

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.50: Improved error message and
	removed stray unused code

2006-03-27  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.56: Removed an outdated HACKALERT.

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.55: ProjectionSheet raises a TypeError
	if an attempt is made to connect anything other than a Projection.

2006-03-27  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py 1.22: Corrected error in previous
	commit.

2006-03-27  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.49: Better error message; added
	ALERT

	* topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.6,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.47, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py
	1.40: Added better checks for whether various plots will be
	successful for the current simulation

	* doc/Future_Work/index_text.php 1.12: More work

2006-03-27  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.19: Updated my tasks

2006-03-27  chrispalmer  <chrispalmer@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or_sf.ty 1.1: initial spatial frequency work

2006-03-27  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.16: Set V1 afferents to
	normalize together. Set afferent connection strengths to have
	strength 1.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.148: Added delattr for _sum
	attribute. Altered commented-out code.

2006-03-25  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php 1.7,
	doc/Tutorials/lissom_or_text.php 1.3: Updated estimates of
	training times based on an actual run!

	* examples/Makefile 1.7: Changed to put .typ files in this
	directory

2006-03-23  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.46: Intermediate checkin; still
	messy.  Added integer scaling option, and sketched eventual
	cleaned up code for resizing.  Turned off sheetcoords by default
	so that ConnectionField would work

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.37,
	topo/commands/or_key_white_vert_small.png 1.1: Changed default
	size of OR key to be a smaller image

	* topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.7: Turned off sheetcoords
	by default so that ConnectionField would work

2006-03-23  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.36: Corrected mistype.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.88: Corrected the doc.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.45: Started an implementation of
	the scrollbar that is commented out. Deleted unused import
	statement. Cleaned up doc and comments. Corrected the use of
	**config by the use of **param in the __init__ method.

2006-03-23  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.44: Added alert

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.43,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.6: Changed actualsize to
	sheetcoords for clarity; made on by default

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.48: Renamed Learning iterations to
	indicate that it's not necessarily learning anything and it's not
	in terms of iterations (!).  Cleaned up time remaining text.

2006-03-22  chrispalmer  <chrispalmer@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.42,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.5: Added actualsize button;
	name not yet decided

	* topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.5,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.39,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.4: Added the simulator name
	to window titles to help users keep multiple simulations straight

2006-03-22  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.41: Deleted unused attribute
	self.plots in PlotGroupPanel.Added doc and comment.

2006-03-22  chrispalmer  <chrispalmer@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.47: Added estimate of time remaining

2006-03-22  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.40, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py
	1.25: Changed the argument pgt_name to name for a
	PlotGroupPanel. There is no references to template in the
	PlotGroup class.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.39, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py
	1.24: Cleaned up reference to a template from PlotGroupPanel. At
	the same time, enabled the normalize button for the
	testpattern. This required reimplementing toggle_normalize in
	the testpattern, but that's only a temporary solution while
	reorganizing the panel hierarchy.

2006-03-22  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.47: Fixed bug in recent checkin;
	scheduled events were failing due to lack of a src or dest for
	which to print information

	* Makefile 1.58, doc/Makefile 1.9: Cleaned up dist package
	generation

2006-03-22  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.54, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.95,
	topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.18: Deleted the
	get_in_projection_by_name in ProjectionSheet. Replaced by using
	the projections() method now that we ensure a unique name for
	projections to the same ProjectionSheet.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.94: Replaced the use of
	get_in_projection_by_name() by the use of projections(). Now that
	the problem of having a unique name is solved, we do not need to
	return a list of projections for a given name. Deleted
	correponding Alert. Cleaned up the doc.

2006-03-22  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile 1.57: More files to clean up for distribution

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.18: Removed completed item

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.12: Added note

	* Makefile 1.56: First pass at creating dist archive

2006-03-21  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.17, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py 1.21:
	Removed global constants Pi and PI. The only syntax is now pi.

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.16: Removed unnecessary exec
	statements.

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.15: Removed unnecessary in
	__main__.__dict__ statements.

2006-03-20  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.14: Removed the start function and
	moved the corresponding code within process_argv.

2006-03-18  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.11, topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.26:
	Corrected DivisiveSumNormalize's test of the current_norm_value.

	* .cvsignore 1.6: Added python_topo directory (which exists on
	Windows).

	* topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.27: Started changing to get
	simulator from topo.sim.

2006-03-18  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.38: Hopefully fixed longstanding
	issues about minimum and initial plot widths. Plots should now
	default properly to around 150 pixels wide, or larger if the Sheet
	has more pixels than that.  The Reduce button will now allow plots
	to be reduced down to one pixel per unit, but no further (at the
	moment)

2006-03-18  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.93, topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py
	1.15, topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.4,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.38,
	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.3: Started changing to get
	simulator from topo.sim.

2006-03-18  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/tiny.ty 1.4: Added explanatory note

	no visible change.

2006-03-18  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/tiny.ty 1.3, topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.25: Added
	abs()-using DivisiveL1Normalize

	* examples/tiny.ty 1.2: Added more example parameters

	* examples/tiny.ty 1.1: Initial version

	* topo/learningfns/som.py 1.1: Moved from basic.py

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.33, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.39,
	examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.27, examples/som_retinotopy.ty
	1.28, topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.17, topo/tests/testfeaturemap.py
	1.12, topo/tests/testpatternpresent.py 1.8,
	topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py 1.11, topo/tests/testplotgroup.py
	1.17, topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.54, topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.26:
	Moved SOM learning functions to topo/learningfns/som

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.146: Added LearningFunction
	abstract class to establish a family of objects for use with
	GenericCFLF

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.29, topo/responsefns/optimized.py
	1.19: Fixed docstrings

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.24: Added alert

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.23: Added alert.  Removed redundant
	constructors

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.45: Added debugging messages

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.145: Added alert

	* topo/projections/optimized.py 1.20,
	topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.18, topo/learningfns/optimized.py
	1.46, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.46: Removed out-of-date
	LISSOM_CPointer, CFDotProduct_CPointer, CFProjection_CPointer, and
	DivisiveHebbian_CPointer; may eventually be resurrected

2006-03-17  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.32: Cleaned up and simplified

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.31: Changed to Chris's new topo.sim
	format

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.38: Fixed typo

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.37: Sorted imports

2006-03-17  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.17: Updates to my tasks.

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.36: Set the simulator name.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.44: Corrected an error in
	SimSingleton's __setattribute__() method.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.43: Removed a HACKALERT from
	SimSingleton.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.42: Corrected logic error in
	SimSingleton.init() that was creating two Simulators (though it
	left only one behind).

2006-03-17  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/main.ppm 1.2, topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.16: Removed
	unnecessary image

2006-03-17  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.41: Cleaned up code for
	dictionary-style access to simulator objects. Doing
	topo.sim['V1']=EP where EP already exists in the simulator results
	in a warning and the object not being added. Doing
	topo.sim['V1']=EP2 where topo.sim['V1'] already exists results in
	the EP already in topo.sim['V1'] being overwritten with EP2 (as
	for dictionaries). Simulator's _event_processors is now a dict
	rather than a list to make things simpler.

2006-03-17  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/time_text.php 1.3: Fixed image sizes

2006-03-17  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.35: Changed to use newer simulator
	syntax: topo.sim['V1'], etc.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.40: SimSingleton uses the simulator's
	repr and str methods.

2006-03-17  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Developer_Manual/optimization_text.php 1.4: Edited Chris's
	text slightly

2006-03-17  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.16: Updated my tasks.

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.27: Reduced SOM radius slightly
	(and random seeds are different).

	* doc/Developer_Manual/index_text.php 1.3,
	doc/Developer_Manual/optimization_text.php 1.3: Added some
	information about how we provide optimized components. It's
	commented out for the moment so JAB can review it.

2006-03-16  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.26, topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.28,
	topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.17: CFEuclideanDistance is the
	basic Python version, CFEuclideanDistance_opt1 is the optimized C
	version.

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.25: Removed unused line of imports.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.144: No visible change. Changed
	commented-out code so it's simpler (still behaves the same).

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.143: Changed sum property's
	documentation. Apart from that, no visible change - altered
	commented-out code.

2006-03-15  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.15: Update after recent
	class changes.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.142: Removed duplicate import
	statement.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.141: Removed optimization from
	GenericCFOF.

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.53: Removed unused references to
	output_fn.

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.10: DivisiveSumNormalizeCFOF sets
	the cfs' sum attribute after normalizing. (Currently has no
	visible effect.)

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.45, topo/outputfns/optimized.py
	1.9: Modified documentation.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.36: Reverted names of projections -
	changes which I accidentally left in.

	* examples/laminar.ty 1.10, examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.35: Uses
	DivisiveSumNormalizeCFOF_opt1 instead of GenericCFOF with
	single_cf_fn=DivisiveSumNormalize_opt1.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.19: Corrected location of
	single_cf_fn for weight initialization.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.140: Removed output_fn Parameter
	accidentally left behind in CFLearningFunction.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.77: Uses DivisiveSumNormalizeCFOF_opt1
	instead of GenericCFOF with
	single_cf_fn=DivisiveSumNormalize_opt1.

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.8: Corrected mistake in
	non-optimized wrapper for DivisiveSumNormalizeCFOF.

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.27: Corrected call to super(), must
	have been missed from a previous set of commits.

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.7: Corrected typo (in the code).

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.6: Uncommented code for
	DivisiveSumNormalizeCFOF and added non-optimized fallback to
	GenericCFOF(single_cf_fn=DivisiveSumNormalize).

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.46: Added return statement so all
	the possible locations aren't opened in open_location().

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.45: Windows users are unlikely to
	have the locally built documentation. Therefore, locations on the
	web are tried if the local copies fail. Also, fixed 'about' text,
	since the ABOUT_TEXT variable in topo/__init__ had been moved into
	a function.

	* topo/__init__.py 1.55: 'About' text can be returned or
	printed. Default is to print, as before.

2006-03-14  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.15: Update to a task.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.139: learn() split tp learn() and
	apply_output_fn(). No visible change. Also committed commented-out
	code in CFSheet's learn().

	* topo/misc/inlinec.py 1.7: Reverted to previous version
	(mistakenly committed).

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.26, topo/responsefns/optimized.py
	1.16, topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.16, examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.30,
	examples/hierarchical.ty 1.34, examples/laminar.ty 1.9,
	examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.34, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.76,
	examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.26, examples/som_retinotopy.ty
	1.24, topo/misc/inlinec.py 1.6: Changed
	response_fns.optimized.CFDotProduct to CFDotProduct_opt1. If
	inline-optimized components aren't available, falls back to
	basic's CFDotProduct.

	* examples/laminar.ty 1.8, examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.33,
	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.75, topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.44:
	Changed learningfns.optimized.Hebbian to Hebbian_opt1. If
	inline-optimized components aren't available, falls back to
	Hebbian.

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.53: Added 'norm_value' Parameter to
	OutputFunction(). This is a hack while ConnectionField assumes all
	OutputFunctions have a norm_value.

	* topo/tests/testoutputfnsoptimized.py 1.2, examples/laminar.ty
	1.7, examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.32, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.74,
	topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.5: Changed
	ouputfns.optimized.DivisiveSumNormalize to
	DivisiveSumNormalize_opt1. If inline-optimized components aren't
	available, falls back to DivisiveSumNormalize.

	* examples/laminar.ty 1.6, examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.31,
	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.73: Removed cache_sum attribute from
	CFProjection.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.43: Hebbian sets cf._sum,
	allowing the sum of the weights to be cached without using the
	slower Python property.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.138: Removed cache_sum; if _sum
	attribute exists, it is assumed that the value is always current.

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.52, topo/learningfns/optimized.py
	1.42, topo/projections/basic.py 1.18, examples/laminar.ty 1.5,
	examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.30, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.72,
	examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.25, topo/base/connectionfield.py
	1.137: Split output_fns from learning_fns. Introduced
	CFOuputFunction class to apply the output_fn to all CFs. Some ways
	things have been done are a little confusing and could be
	simplified (notably caching the sum of a CF's weights), but at the
	moment the example networks should all behave the same.

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.4: Committed some commented-out
	classes (the CF output function doesn't belong here).

	* examples/homeostatic.ty 1.2: Removed apparently unused code.

2006-03-13  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.8: Test of optimized output functions
	runs automatically.

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.3: Added return statements to
	match other output functions.

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.2: Corrected DivisiveSumNormalize
	for when the desired norm_value is not 1.

2006-03-12  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.22: Changed DivisiveSumNormalize so
	that it can accept a pre-calculated norm_value for the array, if
	one is known. If the pre-calculated value is equal to the current
	value, no normalization operation need occur.

2006-03-11  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/outputfns/optimized.py 1.1: Initial
	version. DivisiveSumNormalize intended to be equivalent but faster
	version of that in outputfns/basic.py

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.41: The previous commit was a
	mistake (it was supposed to be outputfns/optimized that I
	committed, not learningfns/optimized). This is the code from
	version 1.39.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.40,
	topo/tests/testoutputfnsoptimized.py 1.1: Initial
	version. DivisiveSumNormalize intended to be equivalent but faster
	version of that in outputfns/basic.py

2006-03-10  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.39: DivisiveHebbian's
	normalization happens every time, whether or not the output
	activity is zero.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.136: Added sum of cf's initial
	weights.

2006-03-09  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* external/mswin/setup.bat 1.7, external/mswin/setup.py 1.12:
	Installation creates a desktop shortcut with the Topographica
	icon.

	* external/mswin/create_shortcut.vbs 1.1: Creates a desktop
	shortcut.

2006-03-08  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* external/mswin/setup.py 1.11: Fixed typo.

	* external/mswin/setup.py 1.10: Removed comment left in by
	accident.

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.13: Filename arguments are enclosed
	in repr() so that bits of Windows paths that look like control
	characters don't turn into control characters. (Note: I don't know
	that the slashes around the string were for originally.)

	* external/mswin/setup.py 1.9: Batch file: changes to Topographica
	path before running, so that the current path variable is correct.

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.15: Changed syntax in
	CFDotProduct: no visible change.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.38: Moving to c++ syntax for
	clarity...no visible change.

	* topo/misc/inlinec.py 1.5: Added verbose=0 to the inline()
	arguments. I'm not sure it actually makes any
	difference. Developers can set it to 2 to see more output for
	debugging; 0 should result in less garbage output for users. See
	the weave documentation (but good luck finding it...try
	old.scipy.org).

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.12: Removed apparently redundant
	try/catch block (there is already one in inlinec.py; in any case,
	if something other than an ImportError occurs I think a user
	should see it).

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.35: Cleanup in DivisiveHebbian -
	no visible change.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.34: Intermediate checkin:
	DivisiveHebbian has learning in one chunk of C, and normalization
	in another. No visible change.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.33: Intermediate checkin: store
	sum of cf's weights in cf.sum, and retrieve. No visible change.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.135: Intermediate checkin: added
	sum attribute to connectionfield.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.32: Normalization factor is
	calculated as the sum of the weights each time, rather than
	accumulating the differences and assuming they summed to 1 in the
	previous iteration. This has a very small effect; after 20000
	iterations, the weights are different in about the 6th decimal
	place, and a sum over the activity in V1 differs in about the
	fifth decimal place.

2006-03-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.11: No visible change: minor change
	to import statement.

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.22: Minor correction to text.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.14: Updated with my current
	tasks.

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.21: Changed Windows installation
	instructions.

	* setup.bat 1.11: Just calls external\mswin\setup.bat

	* external/mswin/setup.bat 1.6, external/mswin/setup.py 1.8: Minor
	changes, plus associates '.ty' files with Topographica.

	* external/mswin/setup.bat 1.5: Minor change - pauses at the end
	in case launched by double clicking.

	* external/mswin/setup.py 1.7: Now generates a script that looks
	more like the one on unix. Fixed a problem with quotation marks.

	* topo/__init__.py 1.54: Added 'release' attribute, which is set
	by the topographica script. Moved ABOUT_TEXT into the about()
	function so that the release value is filled in once it's been
	set, rather than before.

	* Makefile 1.55: Removed setting of TOPORELEASE environment
	variable, and replaced it by setting topo.release.

	* Makefile 1.54: Removed PYTHONPATH.

	* Makefile 1.53: Removed TOPOGRAPHICAPATH.

2006-03-07  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* external/mswin/setup.py 1.6: Hopefully fixes the backslash
	problem for the generated topographica.py script

2006-03-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/optimized.py 1.19, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.45,
	topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.31, topo/responsefns/optimized.py
	1.14: Commented out cpointer code.

2006-03-06  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* external/mswin/setup.py 1.5: Corrected another mistake.

	* external/mswin/setup.py 1.4: Corrected an error with quotation
	marks.

	* external/mswin/setup.bat 1.4, external/mswin/setup.py 1.3,
	external/mswin/topographica.bat 1.3: Various changes to the
	scripts.

	* Makefile 1.52, topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.36: Filename
	parameter gets the path by going up a level from the directory of
	the binary, which works on Windows and unix. There might be a
	better way.

2006-03-06  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.23: Clarified what the snapshot is,
	to distinguish it from the network snapshot

2006-03-06  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* external/mswin/python242_topo_weave.tar.gz 1.2,
	external/mswin/python242_topo.tar.gz 1.2,
	external/mswin/python_topo.tar.gz 1.1: Removed previous versions
	of Python directories and added one back. The new one has weave
	and the mingw c compiler, and is configured to use this c compiler
	by default so it will work on windows without any extra work.

	* external/mswin/setup.bat 1.3, external/mswin/setup.py 1.2,
	external/mswin/topographica.bat 1.2: Updated to work with new
	python_topo.tar.gz

	* Makefile 1.51, external/Makefile 1.31: Instead of setting the
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable after python has started, we
	hard-code the lib/ as the path when we make the python binary.

2006-03-04  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.35: Added a HACKALERT and
	corrected a typo in the code.

	* external/mswin/python242_topo_weave.tar.gz 1.1: Python with
	weave from scipy. Unfortunately includes other things for the
	moment that take up space and could be removed.

	* external/mswin/setup.bat 1.2: Added note on how to get weave.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.34: Removed a HACKALERT.

	* external/mswin/python242_topo.tar.gz 1.1: Python 2.4.2 with
	Numeric, PIL, matplotlib, Pmw, Fixedpoint

	* external/mswin/topographica.bat 1.1: Starts python with the
	topographica.py script. INitial version.

	* external/mswin/setup.py 1.1: Creates topographica.py
	script. Initial version.

	* external/mswin/setup.bat 1.1: Simple windows batch file to
	install ready-made python. Initial version.

	* external/mswin/util/gunzip.exe 1.1, external/mswin/util/tar.exe
	1.1: Utilities for extracting archives.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.33, Makefile 1.50: Added
	TOPOGRAPHICAPATH to environment variables.

2006-03-03  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* external/win32/Numeric-24.2.win32-py2.4.exe 1.3: New version
	(added binary)

	* external/win32/Numeric-24.2.win32-py2.4.exe 1.2: Removed
	apparently-corrupt file. It wasn't added as binary and isn;t the
	same size as the original.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.13: Updated my tasks.

	* external/win32/python-2.4.2.msi 1.3: Added as a binary file.

	* external/win32/python-2.4.2.msi 1.2: Not in binary format. Two
	Windows machines I tried it on said it is invalid; it worked on
	another.

	* external/win32/python-2.4.msi 1.2: Removed Python 2.4 since it's
	not used any more (we have 2.4.2).

	* Makefile 1.49: Topograpgica script: no longer uses os.getenv() -
	instead accesses the os.environ dictionary itself.

	* Makefile 1.48: For topographica script: ignore PYTHONPATH
	environment variable and just use our own Python's path.

2006-03-03  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.12,
	examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ 1.9: Removed saved .typ files, to
	speed up CVS downloads

	* doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php 1.6,
	doc/Tutorials/lissom_or_text.php 1.2: Changed tutorial
	instructions to ask users to build a map rather than assuming it
	is in CVS

	* Makefile 1.47, examples/Makefile 1.6: Added code to generate
	saved example files

	* doc/Future_Work/index_text.php 1.11: Added note about filenames
	as window titles

	* ChangeLog.txt 1.3: Updated with recent changes

	* examples/Makefile 1.5: Added one iteration of execution

	* Makefile 1.46: Changed exec_argv to process_argv to match change
	in commandline.py

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.10: Cleaned up and simplified

	* Makefile 1.44: Minor cleanup to topographica script

2006-03-02 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile 1.43: Removed 'rm topographica' and put back '>
	topographica' instead of '>> topographica' on first line. (I
	didn't realize there was a difference...)

	* Makefile 1.42: Removed TOPO variable from generated
	topographica script code.

	* Makefile 1.41: Changed generated code for topographica
	script. (1) Environment variables are set before any imports
	of Topographica things. (2) Environment variables are not set
	with putenv() (see
	http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.2/lib/os-procinfo.html). (3)
	Removed extra slash in first line. (4) Sorted out ':' between
	paths. (3) and (4) might be wrong and need to be checked.

	* topo/__init__.py 1.53: No visible change - moved import
	statemtements to the top.

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.9: If topographica is started
	with no scripts or commands to run, it opens interactively
	(i.e. './topographica' is the same as './topographica -i').

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.32,
	topo/plotting/templates.py 1.35: Simplified Filename
	Parameter, so it has just one search list.

2006-03-02 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.71: Moved an alert here from
	learningfns/basic.py. (Chris)

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.51: Removed an irrelevant alert
	and moved another to patterngenerator. (Chris)

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.50: Modified commented-out print
	statement to include simulation time. (Chris)

	* Makefile 1.40: Added control over test verbosity

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.8: Fixed scripts to run in main
	(e.g. to get the value of pi defined); not sure why the
	previous syntax was not signalling an error

2006-03-02 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* runtests 1.11: No longer required: tests can be run like
	this:\n./topographica -c 'import topo.tests; topo.tests.run()'

	* Makefile 1.39: Changed how tests are run (no longer uses
	runtests script).

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.7: Added run() function to allow
	tests to be run like this:\n./topographica -c 'import
	topo.tests; topo.tests.run()'

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.31: Added HACKALERT: think
	about Parameter class attributes, remembering they won't
	pickle because Parameter isn't a TopoObject (in most cases
	that's likely to be fine, but some class attributes are
	designed to be set by the user). Moved Filename's
	topographica_path to be an instance attribute for the moment,
	because trying to set it on unpickling wasn't possible since
	it's read-only. This will be investigated at the same time as
	the alert.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.44: Removed a line that should
	have been removed in the previous version.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.39, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.43:
	Got rid of some uses of 'active_sim', and got rid of
	'objects_to_notify_of_active_sim' concept, since the current
	simulator is always in topo.sim.

2006-03-01 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/__init__.py 1.52: Reduced amount imported

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.49: Moved aspect_ratio into the
	default Gaussian neighborhood, because it's conceivable to use
	a non-unity aspect ratio

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.12: Fixed bogus assumption that
	all projections will have a cfs variable, and made it respect
	the measure_maps declaration.  It should now work with
	lissom_oo_or.ty, but it still needs work because it doesn't
	seem to measure any useful map for a SharedWeightProjection

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.7: Clarified help message

	* runtests 1.10: Added ALERT

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.22: Added alert

2006-03-01 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.42: Removed uses of
	get_active_sim().

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.25: Replaced get_active_sim() with
	topo.sim

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.30: No visible change -
	changed a variable name.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.38,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testtopoconsole.py 1.8: Removed
	topo.base.simulator.set_active_sim().

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.21: Just uses topo.sim to get
	the simulator.

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.33: Added some temporary
	demonstration lines for how access to the simulator might
	work.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.37: Simulator supports
	dictionary-like assignment. Temporary method connect2() added
	to work with this.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.41: On initialization, gets
	self.simulator from topo.sim. There is always a simulator
	now. Some plotting menu options need to be updated to check
	there are sheets of the right type to do whatever it is
	they're supposed to do.

	* topo/__init__.py 1.51, topo/base/simulator.py 1.36,
	topo/commands/basic.py 1.24, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.40:
	Added SimSingleton class. Added variable
	topo.sim=SimSingleton(), so there is simulator (empty) on
	startup. SimSingleton() keeps one Simulator() object and
	allows almost-transparent access to it, so topo.sim['V1'] etc
	is possible. Begun changing calls to get_active_sim etc.

2006-03-01 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/homeostatic.ty 1.1: Initial version for Veldri to
	work with

2006-02-28 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* runtests 1.9: Commented out argument-processing to allow
	runtests (and 'make all') to work.

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.23: Uses independent streams for
	input pattern parameters.

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.34: Made image_path be a
	parameter; a path can be 'put through' this to ensure it's
	valid for the OS and that the correct locations are searched.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.29: Filename searches
	prefixes specified for this particular parameter first, then
	common ones.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.28: Filename can be declared
	with None as the path (i.e. no default path). Changed path
	searching method, to allow relative and absolute prefix paths.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.36: Removed path left in by
	mistake, updated doc string.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.27, topo/patterns/image.py
	1.35: For relative paths, Filename now searches both the
	Filename.common_search_paths list and any specific list of
	search_paths an instance is given. Currently
	common_search_paths includes sys.exec_prefix (Topographica
	base directory.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.12: Updated with current
	work.

2006-02-28 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile 1.38, topo/misc/commandline.py 1.6: Changed the
	generate_params and generate_prefixes so that they execute
	commands as they find them instead of creating a string. They
	have been re-named exec_argv and exec_prefixes.

2006-02-28 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.71: Uses RandomWrapper, so x, y, and
	orientation are independent random streams, and resume where
	they left off on pickling.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.26: Added RandomWrapper, a
	modified version of Wrapper, that creates a new Random()
	instance. Gives independent random streams, and allows the
	state of the stream to be saved when pickling.

2006-02-28 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile 1.37, topo/misc/commandline.py 1.5: Modified the
	generate_params and generate_prefixes function in
	commandline.py so that to work with the first copy of python,
	instead of having to re-open a new one. Python options are now
	directly set on the corresponding environment variable, and
	the string of command is then executed with the exec
	command. There is one problem for the verbose option: the
	variable PYTHONVERBOSE is only read during startup, and cannot
	be re-set afterwards. Therefore, the verbose option is
	currently disabled.

2006-02-28 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.4: Added alert

2006-02-27 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.3: Replaced old
	topographica_script code by the new version that uses
	Optparse.

	* topographica_script.py 1.21: Deleted the
	topographica_script.py file; the code has been moved to
	topo.misc.commandline.py.

	* Makefile 1.36: Modified the Makefile to take into account
	that the code of topographica_script has been moved to
	topo/misc/commandline.py; also inserted the variable TOPO into
	the environment. People will have to do a make after the
	update to get a version that works.

	* topo/misc/commandline.py 1.2: Moved the topographica_script
	code to topo/misc/commandline.py.

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.48: Set the x and y to 0 when
	creating the Gaussian instead of when calling it. That allows
	more flexibility for the user.

2006-02-27 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.35: Added more helpful error to
	__getattribute__(), for if a string is not given.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.34: Added dictionary-like object
	access for Simulator: for a Simulator s, s['V1'] does
	s.objects()['V1'].

2006-02-27 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.33: Fixed typo

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.35: Minor comment cleanup

	* doc/Future_Work/.cvsignore 1.2: Added current page

2006-02-26 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.32: Input pattern parameters set
	on objects, rather than the class. I use two independent
	objects here, though for the moment they aren't really
	independent because everything shares one stream of random
	numbers.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.11: Updated my tasks.

	* examples/laminar.ty 1.4, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.70: Input
	pattern parameters set on a Gaussian object rather than the
	Gaussian class.

	* examples/laminar.ty 1.3: Some things will not deepcopy, such
	as Numeric's ufuncs. Added a Wrapper class (which will be
	renamed and will probably be changed to operate differently)
	that allows these things to be
	deepcopied. CompositePatternGenerator used a ufunc, so is
	changed to use a Wrapper. Lambdas will also not deepcopy;
	Wrapper does not support them, but does offer an
	alternative. Examples files that used lambdas are changed
	accordingly.

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.23: save_snapshot and load_snapshot
	are changed to include pickling of class attributes.

	* topo/misc/utils.py 1.3: Added a function (which could be
	simplified) to search modules and retrieve class' states.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.60, examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.29,
	examples/hierarchical.ty 1.31, examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.29,
	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.69, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.24,
	examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.22, topo/base/connectionfield.py
	1.134, topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.25: Some things will
	not deepcopy, such as Numeric's ufuncs. Added a Wrapper class
	(which will be renamed and will probably be changed to operate
	differently) that allows these things to be
	deepcopied. CompositePatternGenerator used a ufunc, so is
	changed to use a Wrapper. Lambdas will also not deepcopy;
	Wrapper does not support them, but does offer an
	alternative. Examples files that used lambdas are changed
	accordingly.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.34: ParameterizedObject
	has __getstate__() that only returns instance data (before it
	also returned class data). Also, it deep copies any instance
	attribute that is a Parameter. Parameter has support for
	deepcopy and pickle with its own __getstate__ and __setstate__
	(required because Parameter uses __slots__, and does not have
	a __dict__).

2006-02-25 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/index_text.php 1.10: More to do

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.39: Added indication of why the
	GUI is exiting

2006-02-24 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.33: No visible change:
	commented-out code for new __getstate__().

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.22: No visible change: new
	commented-out code for replacement snapshot functions.

	* topo/misc/utils.py 1.2: No visible change: new commented-out
	code for a recursive module search. Might not belong here.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.24: No visible change: a
	commented-out Wrapper class.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.32: No visible change:
	commented-out code for __getstate__() and __setstate__() of
	Parameter.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.10: Updated what I'm
	working on.

	* topo/__init__.py 1.50: ABOUT text includes the Topographica
	release number.

2006-02-24 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.33: Made normalize be a
	BooleanParameter, and corrected the templates where it was
	passed in as a string. Cleaned up ALERTS.

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.31: Cleaned up doc and ALERTS.

2006-02-24 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	density (which has been changed by mistake in the previous
	commit.

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.47: Ensured that the
	neighborhood matrix is defined with x=0 and y=0.

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.20: Corrected the
	som_retinotopy example such as not setting x,y and orientation
	directly on the Gaussian class, but rather creating a Gaussian
	object and assigning it to the GeneratorSheet.

2006-02-23 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.8: Added task, moved
	another to current work section.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.17: Projection imported to
	projections/basic.py so that it's part of the projections
	package.

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.52: Projection is an abstract
	class.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.7: Added a task, changed
	some others round.

2006-02-23 alan_lindsay <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.25: Fixed a wee typo (Ta
	Chris).

2006-02-23 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.23, topo/base/utils.py 1.64:
	find_classes_in_package() returns the base class, but does not
	return any abstract classes.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.66: Sheet is declared to be an abstract
	class.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.65: Continued to write Slice
	class. Added methods sheet2matrix() and matrix2sheet() to
	Sheet. This is still a work in progress - there won't be so
	many functions by the end.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.34: Tidied up import statements.

2006-02-23 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.31: Changed
	ParameterizedObject.__repr__ to use __repr__ for attribute
	values also, to get closer to a valid Python expression

2006-02-23 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.6: Corrected html tag
	error.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.5: Removed a task and
	added another to the doing next section.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.133,
	topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.22,
	topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.70, topo/base/projection.py
	1.51: ClassSelectorParameter subclasses have packages
	attribute that works properly.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.21: Corrected mistake
	introduced in the previous-but-one version.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.20: Minor updates

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.132,

	* examples/Makefile 1.4: Made default LISSOM test be oo_or
	instead of or to test more code

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.4: Cleaned up and
	reworded

2006-02-22 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.30: __repr__() returns
	almost-runnable expression.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.3: Removed a task; moved
	another to currently-working-on section.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.64, topo/base/simulator.py 1.32: No
	longer overrides __repr__().

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.29: ParameterizedObject's
	__repr__() returns <classname name> and a list of all
	Parameters. __str__() returns <classname name>.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.17: ClassSelectorParameter's
	suffix_to_lose defaults to empty string rather than None
	(which it did before I accidentally changed it).

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.16,
	topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.23: ClassSelectorParameter doesn't
	list abstract_classes.

	* topo/patterns/random.py 1.20: RandomGenerator declared to be
	an abstract class.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.60: Moved topo/base/utils.py
	to topo/misc/utils.py

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.28,
	topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.68: Classes now have an
	'abstract' attribute which is True if the class declares an
	_abstract_class_name equal to its name and False otherwise
	(i.e. if it doesn't declare _abstract_class_name, or it's set
	to False. Abstract classes can be instantiated.

2006-02-22 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.15: Added the possibility to
	change the default value for instantiate when creating a
	ClassSelectorParameter.

	the first few iterations.  Fixed bug in tsettle.  Removed
	cortical edge buffers.

2006-02-22 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/arrayutils.py 1.6, topo/base/utils.py 1.62,
	topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.21: Moved clip_in_place() from

	comments.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.26: Removed HACKALERT

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.14, topo/base/utils.py 1.61:
	classname_repr() moved to be a method of
	ClassSelectorParameter.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.13,
	topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.67, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py
	1.22: Added suffix_to_lose to ClassSelectorParameter, allowing
	that suffix to be removed when the class name is
	displayed. PatternGeneratorParameter removes 'Generator' by
	default.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.60: Cleaned up documentation and
	removed unused import for classname_repr().

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.63, topo/base/simulator.py 1.31:
	__repr__() is overridden to print more useful information.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.59: classname_repr() no longer inserts
	spaces before capital letters.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.25: Made __str__() use
	__repr__() (both previously contained the same code).

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.24: Removed HACKALERT
	about name-sharing; added a HACKALERT about printing more
	useful info at the commandline.

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.2: Added task (CB).

	* doc/Future_Work/current_text.php 1.1: Initial version,
	biased towards my work.

2006-02-21 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.44: Changed tsettle into a positive
	Integer parameter instead of a plain attribute

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.43: Fixed for cases where there are
	multiple sheets in the model -- it had been counting the
	number of times pre_sleep was called, which happens whenever
	any input event occurs.  Now it counts the number of actual
	activations for this sheet instead.  Should not change the
	results for lissom_or.ty, but should change the results for
	lissom_oo_or.ty (which should do one less settling step now)

2006-02-21 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.59: Minor alterations to
	CompositePatternGenerator.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.58: Composite is now in a state
	where it can be tried out usefully in the test pattern window
	(to see better how it should finally work). But the
	implementation is temporary.

2006-02-20 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.23,
	topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.66: Example of how we could
	prevent instantiation of abstract classes, PatternGenerator in
	this case. Since the super() call requires the class itself
	inside the call anyway, putting it in there again is not too
	much trouble...

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.12: Change to a HACKALERT.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.58: Added to documentation.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.22: Changed
	__param_inheritance() to look up the classlist (superclasses)
	itself, rather than having it passed in. Renamed uses of
	'base_classes' to 'superclasses'; previously there was
	confusion between 'bases' returned from classlist() and bases
	as passed to the metaclass' __init__() method.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.21: __param_inheritance()
	changed to look at all slots, not just those in the immediate
	class (so e.g. a Number parameter does inheritance for
	bounds,softbounds and all the slots of its superclasses
	(Parameter in this case)).

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.20: Moved classlist() and
	descendents() to beginning of file.

	be a BooleanParameter

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.10: Added CallableParameter

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.32: Added

	densities to be toggled on/off.

2006-02-19 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.16, topo/base/sheet.py
	1.62, topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.30: Removed Constant
	Parameter, since it is the same as Parameter(constant=True).

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.16: Changed Constant to a
	LearningFunctionParameter(constant=True)

2006-02-19 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.24: Made period and phase
	parameter be Number instead of Parameter.

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.45,
	topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.29,
	topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.130: Moved the declaration of
	the ouput_fn parameter in the superclass CFLearningFunction,
	instead of re-declaring it in all sub-classes.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.28: Cleaned up parameter doc
	string, changed output_fn for for DivisiveHebbian and
	DivisiveHebbian_Cpointer to be OutputFunctionParameter rather
	than Constant.

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.44: Cleaned up parameters doc
	string.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.129: Added period to doc
	strings.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.29: Added alert about not being
	able to decalrestep_mode and register Parameter as
	BooleanParameter.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.63: Declared BoundingBox
	parameters as BoundingRegionParameter rather than Parameter.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.128: Declared BoundingBox
	parameters as BoundingRegionParameter rather than
	Parameter. Added some parameter doc string. Transformed
	CFProjection learning_rate parameter to be a
	Number. Transformed CF x and y parameters to be Numbers as
	well.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.68: Deleted ommitted code added for
	testing purpose.

2006-02-19 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.127: Cleaned up doc strings

2006-02-19 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.126: Added a doc string for
	the learning_fn parameter of a CFProjection.

	* topo/projections/optimized.py 1.18: Declared the
	CFProjection_Cpointer learning_fn parameter as a
	LearningFunctionParameter rather than a Parameter.

	* topo/projections/optimized.py 1.17: Declared the
	CFProjection_Cpointer response_fn parameter as a
	ResponseFunctionParameter rather than a Parameter.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.125: Added a doc string for
	the response_fn parameter of a CFProjection.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.15, topo/learningfns/basic.py
	1.43, topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.27,
	topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.124, topo/base/projection.py
	1.48: Changed the output_fn declared as Parameters to be
	declared as OutputFunctionParameter. I added a doc string when
	needed, that might need to be reviewed. I tried to see in
	which case this doc string was already inherited, and not
	added it in such case.

2006-02-19 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.21: Made
	BoundingRegionParameter instantiate by default

2006-02-19 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.28, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.67:
	Deleted the dest_port setting when creating a
	CFProjection. Now, it is possible for different projections to
	the same sheet to share the same dest_port (as soon as they
	are named differently).

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.47: Solved the problem of the port
	for Projection: first, ensure that all the projection to the
	same ProjectionSheet are named differently by raising an error
	if intenting to do so; second, allow all the projection
	sharing the same ports to be activated (by removing the
	break in the activate method).

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.85, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.91:
	Replaced the old bounds.aarect().lbrt() syntax by
	bounds.lbrt().

2006-02-19 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.61: Made bounds be a
	BoundingRegionParameter, and density be a constant Parameter

	BoundingRegionParameter

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.28: Added EventProcessorParameter
	for src and dest of an EPConnection

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.46: Added docstring

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.8,
	topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.15: Added ALERT

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.60, topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.123:
	Replaced the old bounds.aarect().lbrt() syntax by
	bounds.lbrt().

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.19: Added a lbrt() method to
	the BoundingBox. It should make Chris happy by allowing him to
	to do bounds.lbrt().

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.66: Corrected the Retina edge
	buffer.

2006-02-19 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.7: Fixed exceptions to be
	classes

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.18: Added Cartesian2DPoint
	parameter, and changed BoundingCircle to use it and Number
	instead of Parameter

	* ChangeLog.txt 1.2: Added new entries

2006-02-18 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.122, topo/base/simulator.py
	1.27: Made a few more parameters constant

2006-02-18 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.14,
	topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.56: Corrected a doc referring
	to topo.base.parameter.

2006-02-18 alan_lindsay <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.22: Line view bounds check
	sorted.

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.10: Updates class parameters
	without update button

2006-02-18 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/parameter_text.php 1.4: Tried to break text
	up a little.

	* doc/User_Manual/parameter_text.php 1.3: Continued writing...

2006-02-18 alan_lindsay <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.21, topo/tkgui/editortools.py
	1.9, topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.18: Added Refresh, Enlarge,
	Reduce buttons and an error message for when connections don't
	happen.

2006-02-18 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/parameter_text.php 1.2: Continued writing;
	still incomplete.

2006-02-18 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/commandline_text.php 1.3,
	doc/User_Manual/images/matrixvectorplot.png 1.1,
	doc/User_Manual/images/sine_plot.png 1.1: Added plot
	screenshots

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.6,
	topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.13: Cleaned up and
	generalized the documentation.  Renamed methods and variables
	that referred to Topographica, since the classes are now fully
	general

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.20: Added note about make -k

2006-02-18 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.12: Removed
	get_param_dict() because it simply returns attributes of the
	TopoObject (and its superclasses) that are Parameters.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.11: Tidied comments.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.10: Moved two functions
	to the end of the file.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.5,
	topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.9: Moved a HACKALERT

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.55: Parameters with
	attribute constant==True are set non-editable for an object,
	and editable for a class (i.e. no visible change, just updated
	for constant attribute of Parameter).

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.121: weights_shape is set to
	be a constant Parameter.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.54: Corrected import for
	classlist. There might be other files with this mistake?

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.4: Removed HACKALERT.

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.3,
	topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.8: Moved Constant to
	parameterclasses.py

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.7: Parameters can have a
	'constant' attribute. If this is True, they cannot be set on
	an initialized TopoObject (and they are also
	instantiated). The Constant Parameter is now simply a
	Parameter with constant=True. Constant parameters are now no
	longer excluded from pickling - they are pickled like
	everything else. Such changes go together because deepcopy
	uses __getstate__ and __setstate__, as does pickling.

2006-02-17 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.14: All
	SharedWeightCFProjections were sharing the same
	cf_slice_and_bounds list because it was declared as a class
	attribute.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.6: Removed print
	statement accidentally left behind.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.5: Corrected mistake in
	previous commit.

	* topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.4: get_name() doesn't
	just look in the immediate class for the parameter, but in the
	whole class hierarchy. Before, None was being returned
	sometimes. That had broken pickling.

2006-02-17 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameterclasses.py 1.2,
	topo/base/parameterizedobject.py 1.3: Moved Parameter (and
	associated functions class_list() and descendents()) in
	parameterizedobject.py. I also momentarily moved Constant,
	until the use of this class in Parameter is deleted (Chris
	should fix that). Parameter and Constant are still imported
	in parameterclasses.py, so that we can still import any
	Parameter class from parameterclasses.py.

2006-02-17 alan_lindsay <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

2006-02-17 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.23: Moved alert here from
	som_retinotopy.ty

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.18: Simplified slightly

2006-02-17 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.115: Added wrapper around
	hebbian() so deepcopy works. TopoObject needs to have its
	support for deepcopy corrected.

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.27: Renamed __set_name() to
	__generate_name().

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.26: If a Parameter is a
	TopoObject, and it's deepcopied for a new TopoObject, it's
	renamed.

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.25: No visible change: created a
	simple __set_name() method from the original line of code in
	topoobject. (Done because it will be used when Parameters are
	deepcopied to new objects.)

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.24: Added HACKALERT about the
	possibility of TopoObjects sharing the same name.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.114, topo/base/topoobject.py
	1.23, topo/projections/basic.py 1.10: Added wrapper around
	mdot so deepcopy works. TopoObject needs to have its support
	for deepcopy corrected.

	* topo/base/arrayutils.py 1.4: Added temporary wrapper class
	around mdot.

2006-02-16 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.22: Had to add a HACK - some
	things don't seem to deepcopy.

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.39: A Parameter has an 'instantiate'
	attribute (previously 'value_semantics') that indicates
	whether or not a TopoObject should copy the Parameter into its
	own __dict__. instantiate defaults to False for Parameter, but
	True for certain subclasses (e.g. ClassSelectorParameter,
	Constant).

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.58, topo/base/parameter.py 1.51,
	topo/base/topoobject.py 1.21: topo/sheets/lissom.py

2006-02-15 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/laminar.ty 1.1: Initial version from Judith

2006-02-15 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.113, topo/sheets/cfsom.py
	1.22: Added a mysterious test (if proj.input_buffer), that I
	previously deleted in CFSheet abd CFSOM learn() function, but
	that happens to be needed. This will be solved tomorrow.

	* topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.21: Modified the CFSOM learning
	function so that it calls the learn() function on the
	projections, instead of re-implementing it.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.112, topo/base/projection.py
	1.42: Added a learn() function for Projections, which is
	called from the CFSheet learn() function.

2006-02-15 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.26,
	examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ 1.7: Increased ON connection
	strength to 0.75. C++ LISSOM normalizes all its afferent
	weights to 1 so the ON and OFF channel can have different
	effects; topographica doesn't so we compensate by increasing
	the ON connection strength until we support joint
	normalization.

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.13: density and
	output_fn set on V1 rather than on LISSOM.

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.12: Various changes
	to help match c++ lissom (adding edge buffers) and to make the
	file clearer.

2006-02-14 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.14: min_radius is deleted from
	the args if it's passed in, so that it's not passed to the
	superclass. Removed a hackalert.

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.11:
	SharedWeightCFProjection.learning_fn.output_fn set to
	DivisiveSumNormalize, rather than being set on the Projections
	separately.

2006-02-14 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/or_key_white_vert.png 1.2: Flipped to fix

2006-02-14 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.88: Added the possibility of
	passing SheetView plot_template to a ConnectionField
	PlotGroupTemplate. If the plot_template uses the keyword
	'Weights' for the Strength, we request a UnitView, otherwise
	we create a normal plot with Strength specifying a
	SheetView. This not at all effective so far, because no such
	template are declared (also the displaying of labels is not
	exactly consistent between a connection field plot, and a
	normal SheetView plot, but still it looks alright).

	* topo/tkgui/connectionfieldspanel.py 1.2: Corrected a typo
	mistake in the label display.

2006-02-14 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/parameter_text.php 1.1: Beginnings of
	Parameter documentation. Committed while I change locations...

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.20: Added HACKALERT about
	parameter inheritance.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.25:
	SharedWeightCFProjection.learning_fn.output_fn set to
	DivisiveSumNormalize, instead of setting the projections'
	learning_fn.output_fns separately.

2006-02-14 alan_lindsay <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.19, topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py
	1.17: Changed the way you change the view of connectioons and
	sheets. Radius' are represented, though, it seems like
	connections might not be reporting the truth..

2006-02-13 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorials/som_retinotopy_text.php 1.4: Minor cleanup

2006-02-13 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.87: Deleted the added_list
	attribute and the add() function in PlotGroup. It was an
	unused concept, and we can still add Plots to a PlotGroup
	since its plot_list attribute is public.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.86: Added a function
	_ordering_plots in PlotGroup. It is called by plots() before
	returning the plot_list. It allows to only have to
	re-implement this simple function in ProjectionPlotGroup,
	instead of the whole plots() function.

2006-02-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/space_text.php 1.4: Minor changes.

2006-02-13 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.85: Deleted a unused attribute
	self.all_plots.

2006-02-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php 1.5: Changed Afferent0
	that was left over to LGNOnAfferent.

2006-02-13 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.37: Modified the sorting of
	the projections in the projection_menu: now they are first
	sorted with the precedence number of there source Sheet and
	then by alphabetical order. Also added a comment about
	re-writing the function _create_projection_dict(), which is
	quite messy.

	* topo/base/sheetview.py 1.11: Made the UnitView precedence
	parameter to be set to the value of the
	projection.src.precedence parameter (the precedence number of
	the source Sheet). That allows the plot in the
	connectionfieldpanel to be sorted accordingly.

2006-02-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ 1.6: Same map, but with
	updates to code in the pickle.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.50, topo/base/sheet.py 1.57,
	topo/base/topoobject.py 1.19: Parameter has a
	'value_semantics' attribute. TopoObject copies the Parameter
	into its own dictionary if this is set True. This is just a
	demonstration of how we could do explicit value semantics:
	setting value_semantics=True on any parameter means a copy
	of its default value is always given to a new TopoObject. So
	for a Constant parameter, setting value_semantics=True makes
	the Constant truly constant. There is one example of this for
	demonstration: Sheet's bounds. Presumably the attribute
	shouldn't actually be called value_semantics.

2006-02-13 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php 1.4,
	doc/Tutorials/images/natural_image_oo_or.png 1.2: Fixes and
	cleanup

2006-02-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.28: Updated to take account of
	patterngenerator being passed the true xdensity and ydensity
	rather than just the density. Added hackalert.

2006-02-13 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorials/images/or_key_vert_transparent_topo.png 1.2:

	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.64, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.22,
	examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.17: BoundingBox can be created by

2006-02-13 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Developer_Manual/.cvsignore 1.2,

2006-02-13 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.10: BoundingBox can

	of the previous radial_bounds() function.

2006-02-13 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

2006-02-12 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.49: Changed variable name in
	Constant to make the code clearer. The previous version does
	appear to work - I appear to have been confusing myself while
	testing it.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.48: Simple version of Constant that
	ought to work, but appears not to.

2006-02-12 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.10: Simplified CFDotProduct
	C++ code by moving declarations to where they are needed

2006-02-12 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.47: Changed Constant's attepted set
	error to a TypeError.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.46: Removed a HACKALERT that should
	have been removed a while back.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.45: Constant parameter is now
	constant (i.e. doesn't inherit changes once it's been
	created).

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.56: Removed 'default=' from Constant
	declarations.

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.38: The LISSOM sheet output_fn
	Parameter is set in the constructor, rather than being
	re-declared at the class level. This means that each LISSOM
	sheet object has its own output_fn by default, rather than all
	LISSOM sheets sharing one object.

2006-02-12 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.14: Changed the sorting of
	the region_menu, so that to start by high area instead of low
	area.

	* topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.13: Sorted the region_menu
	for a CFSheetPlotPanel, according to the precedence parameter
	of the sheets.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.84: Changed the sort_plots
	function (and introduced a new cmp_plot function) to sort
	according to bith the precedence and the alphabetical order.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.109: Forgotten CFSheet
	precedence default value in previous commit.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.81: Added an attribute precedence to
	a Plot, that is 0.0 by default, and a copy of the SheetViews
	used for making the plot (set at the same time as the
	src_name).

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.37, topo/commands/analysis.py
	1.11, topo/base/sheetview.py 1.10: Added a precedence
	attribute to the SheetView, which is a copy of the sheet
	precedence parameter, passed when creating a SheetView.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.55, topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.20,
	topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.37: Added a parameter precedence to
	the Sheet objects. It gives a sorting information for plot
	display.

2006-02-12 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.26: Fixed bug when plotting
	selectivities higher than 1.0; now crops h,s,v before calling
	hsv2rgb.  Silenced warning from PIL.

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.17: Cleanup of Windows
	instructions in progress

	* doc/Developer_Manual/testing_text.php 1.2: Minor
	clarification

	* examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ 1.5: Retrained the map

2006-02-12 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.54: Initializes activity matrix
	correctly. Added HACKALERT: here and elsewhere there is
	duplication of code.

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.21: Now uses
	PatternGenerator correctly.

2006-02-12 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

2006-02-12 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.54, topo/patterns/image.py 1.27:
	Removed 'precedence constants' since we have decided on an
	ordering for the parameters.

2006-02-12 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.35: Corrected an error in
	load_image.

2006-02-12 ceball <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.108,
	topo/projections/basic.py 1.9: Initialization of the cfs in
	CFProjection.__init__() can be disabled. SharedWeightCFProjection
	uses this to avoid initializing the cfs (since it only requires a
	single, shared cf - that it was previously initializing all the
	cfs was an error, causing its initialization time to be much
	longer than necessary).

2006-02-12 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* ChangeLog 1.5, ChangeLog.txt 1.1: Moved ChangeLog to

2006-02-12 julienciroux <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.21: Set the retina and LGN edge
	buffer.

2006-02-12 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* ChangeLog 1.4: Added recent changes

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.20: Updated gui attribute names
	to match Alan's recent changes

2006-02-12 alan_lindsay <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.48: Allows class constants
	to be set, crudely. A dictionary of dictionaries, holding only
	the objects changed by the user is used to allow values to be
	mainained after closing the parameterframe.

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.16, topo/tkgui/editortools.py
	1.8, topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.16: Changed method and
	variable names to coincide with the rest of
	Topographica. Activity plots are now mapped correctly onto
	sheets and the shape and size of a sheets bounding box is
	represented by the editor sheet.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.55: Added extra translator functions
	for features in ParameterFrame.

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.27: ModelEditor uses gui_x
	instead of guiX, same for y.

2006-02-12 Jim Bednar <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

2006-02-10  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ 1.3: Removed - something went
	wrong with the previous commit. Will replace.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ 1.2: Slied in measure_maps code
	and change to input_generator.

	* doc/Tutorials/lissom_oo_or_text.php 1.1: Initial version -
	unchecked.

	for oo_or tutorial.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.19: Positioned network for model
	editor. Replaced lambda functions for getting random.uniform value
	with a class (to allow pickling); this class will be moved.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.18: LGN declared with
	measure_maps=False.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.36: Sheets with a measure_maps
	attribute, and with it set True, get their maps measured - others
	do not.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.107: Added a 'measure_maps'
	attribute to CFSheet.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.17: No longer have
	afferent_weight_bounds, lgn_weight_bounds, and
	input_bounds. Instead, bounds are just created by radial_bounds().

2006-02-10  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/space_text.php 1.3: Minor clarification

2006-02-10  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.16: Eliminated inhibitory_ and
	excitatory_weight_bounds variables, instead just creating the
	bounds where the projection is defined.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.15, topo/base/connectionfield.py
	1.106: Renamed wt_bounds() to radial_bounds().

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.14: Gaussian class' parameters are
	not now set; instead, parameters on the Retina's input_generator
	are set.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.44: Added a hack to allow
	DynamicNumbers to work when they are set on an object.

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.19: Hacked the hack in load_snapshot to
	allow examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ to keep its dynamic input
	pattern numbers. Because the unpickleable lambda functions for
	generating random numbers are used in two different ways now,
	there are two different hacks here. Once we eliminate those lambda
	functions, it should all be ok.

2006-02-10  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.53, topo/base/simulator.py 1.23: Added

	* examples/lissom_oo_or_20000.typ 1.1: Initial version.

2006-02-09  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.13: Updates to match
	lissom_oo_or_reference.ty.

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.9: delta and beta values
	corrected.

2006-02-09  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.27: Added the color_key to the
	Orientation Preference PlotGroupTemplate.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.34: Changed the function
	load_image; now, all topographica plot are resized to be the close
	as possible to the height of the biggest topographica plot; then,
	the static_images are resized to be of this height. There is still
	a warning about using the image.resize function with floats that
	we need to take care about.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.83: Set the resize parameter to
	False when creating static image plot.

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.25: Added a resize attribute for a
	bitmap; it is set to True by default. It is a flag that allows
	distinguishing between topographica plot and static external
	images when resizing them.

	* doc/images/color_key.png 1.1: Added the color_key png file in
	doc/images.

2006-02-09  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.8: Corrected setting
	LGN's density - I probably re-introduced accidentally setting it
	on the CFSheet class.

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.7: Removed bounds change
	that has no effect at this density. Updated learning rates.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.11: Updated parameters to match the
	ones in lissom_oo_or_reference.ty. There are more to go...

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.10: Simplified weights bounds
	specification with wt_bounds().

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.6: Removed last
	change_bounds for lateral excitatory connection because it
	wouldn't occur anyway for this density.

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.25: Added note to myself.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.63: Added a HACAKLERT about missing
	scheduled events.

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.5: Use wt_bounds()
	function to set weight bounds. Included min_exc_rad parameter.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.105: Removed print statement
	accidentally left in previous commit.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.104: Added wt_bounds(), which
	allows a bounding box to be created with simple syntax from a
	radius. Also allows specification of a minimum radius. Added a
	HACKALERT about the change_bounds warning.

	* topo/tests/oo_or_map_topo.log 1.2: About 20000 iterations from
	the equivalent c++ lissom simulation.

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.4: Learning rates set on
	correct projections.

2006-02-09  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/images/.cvsignore 1.5: More to ignore

	* doc/User_Manual/images/connection_field.fig 1.4,
	doc/User_Manual/images/matrix_coords.fig 1.4,
	doc/User_Manual/images/matrix_coords_hidensity.fig 1.2,

	1.1, doc/User_Manual/images/sheet_coords_-0.2_0.4.fig 1.1: Made
	images line up; added some missing elements and removed some stray
	ones, and added markings for similar features in different plots

	* doc/User_Manual/background_text.php.m4 1.2,
	doc/User_Manual/basics_text.php.m4 1.3,
	doc/User_Manual/features_text.php.m4 1.3,
	doc/User_Manual/images/Makefile 1.3,
	doc/User_Manual/space_text.php 1.2, doc/User_Manual/time_text.php
	1.2: Reduced image sizes to allow two side by side, and added such
	plots where appropriate

	* doc/Future_Work/index_text.php 1.8: More work

2006-02-08  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.3: LGNOn and LGNOff to V1
	connection strengths halved. LGNOn and LGNOff sheet bounds
	adjusted. (Chris)

2006-02-08  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.82: Added a function
	_add_static_images() in TemplatePlotGroup. It creates the Plot
	specified by the static_images attribute of the PlotGroupTemplate,
	and add them to the added_list of Plot (This will still need some
	clean up).

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.26: Added an attribute
	static_images to the PlotGroupTemplate and a method
	add_static_image; static_images is a KeyedList of tuple
	(name,file_path) specifying a Plot from an image file. It will
	enable specifying additional static plots to a PlotGroupTemplate
	(e.g. color key for Orientation Preference). There is no images
	added to a template yet, because the re-sizing needs to be fixed
	in PlotGroupPanel; therefore, the line is commented out for the
	moment.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.80: Added a missing import statement;
	added a call to the super class in the Plot __init__.

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.24, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.79:
	Deleted the unuseful FileBitmap class.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.78, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.81,
	topo/tests/testplot.py 1.16, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.20:
	Renamed make_plot() to make_template_plot().

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.77: Changed the Plot hierarchy: now the
	Plot class is really simple and just creates its bitmap from an
	image; the former Plot class has been renamed TemplatePlot, and
	others sub-classes inherit from it. It remains to re-name the
	make_plot function to make_template_plot. Also deleted the
	BitmapPlot class which is now replaced by the simple Plot class.

2006-02-08  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.24: Change to a comment.

	* topo/tests/lissom_oo_or_reference.ty 1.2: Updates to parameters

	parameters don't yet match the equivalent c++ simulation.

	* topo/tests/oo_or_map_topo.log 1.1: log file from
	oo_or_map_topo.param c++ simulation.

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.23: Added some comments.

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.9: Corrected typo in
	afferent_weight_bounds.

2006-02-07  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.9: Simplified the
	CFEuclideanDistance function; got rid of the optimization in the
	code.

2006-02-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.8: Updated alpha and beta
	(V1.outputfn bounds).

2006-02-07  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.8: Continued to clean up the
	CFDotProduct() code, using C++ syntax.

2006-02-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.7: Changed bounding boxes for
	circular rfs.

2006-02-07  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.7: Simplified version of
	CFDotProduct().It still needs some clean up (e.g using C++
	syntax). It seems to perform a bit better than the previous
	optimized version; in any case it does not do worse (most of the
	times, the profiling statistics are better for the new version).

2006-02-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.62: Last commit contained an error -
	switched commented afferent_weights_bounds with uncommented.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.61: No visible change. Committed
	commented-out code for circular connection fields (including
	adjustments to input_bounds.

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.22: Undid previous
	changes. I didn't notice that in c++ lissom the changes to
	e.g. exc_radius were accumulating.

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.21: Altered to match
	equivalent c++ lissom simulation: scheduled lateral excitatory
	bounds changes, scheduled lateral excitatory learning rates,
	scheduled afferent learning rates.

	* topo/tests/or_map_topo.log 1.7: 20001 iterations from c++
	lissom's or_map_topo.param

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.6: Added learning rates and scheduled
	changes to them for LGN ON/OFF afferents. Added some comments.

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.6: Same change to
	CFEuclideanDistance as to CFProjection (i.e. same changes as were
	made to CFProjection in the previous two commits).

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.5: Removed the variables or and
	oc (that were having no effect and should have been removed in the
	previous version).

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.4: Removed an apparently
	problematicoptimization from CFProjection, but it needs to be done
	properly. Julien is going to do this, and make the same change to
	CFEuclideanDistance.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.47: Allows the current value to
	belong to a class that is not one of the usual classes for a given
	parameter. This allows CFProjections to be manipulated.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.46: Seems to allow updating of
	connections and sheets and selected classes within fields of
	these.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.45: Allows a dictionary, with a
	list entry for fields of the object, to be passed in; these lists
	are searched for object covers for each of the possible classes of
	a class selector item. Works for sheets.

2006-02-05  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/or_map_topo.log 1.6: About 200 iterations from

	statement.

2006-02-04  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.54: a method that takes a dictionary and a
	key and returns dictionary[key] or key if it doesn't exist.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.44: First attempt at allowing a
	translator dictionary to be passed to parameter frame, has broken
	embedded class property windows though.

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.15: Displays activity as soon as
	you set it. Does not need refreshed anymore.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.43: Class selector fields can
	have there properties modified. These are lost as soon as the
	original object is updated. Works for TestPatterns.

2006-02-03  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorials/som_retinotopy_text.php 1.2: Fixed paths

	assert line in previous commit.

	* topo/tests/tkgui/__init__.py 1.7,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py 1.2: Corrected a
	strange bug in testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py. The 'case' notation
	was not working there.. maybe because the tests/tkgui/ directory
	is a sub-directory?

2006-02-03  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/tkgui/__init__.py 1.6: Commented out import of test

	layout at start of file to look more like equivalent c++ lissom
	params file. The input pattern is identical to C++ lissom, but the
	activity in V1 has not yet been matched (the parameters aren't
	all being used correctly).

2006-02-02  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.21: Corrected the initial and
	final learning rate value, according to the new changes in
	learning rate computation in HebbianSOMLF().

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.80: Fixed sort_plot() according to
	the new changes in Plot. Cleaned up comments and doc.

	* topo/tests/tkgui/__init__.py 1.5,

	topo/tests/tkgui/testbasicplotgrouppanel.py 1.5,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py 1.1: Renamed
	testbasicplotgrouppanel.py to testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py. Also
	deleted testactivitypanel.py and put the code that was in it into
	testtemplateplotgrouppanel.py.

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testbasicplotgrouppanel.py 1.4: Forgotten in
	previous commit.

	topo/tkgui/templateplotgrouppanel.py 1.1,
	topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.31: Renamed basicplotgrouppanel.py to
	templateplotgrouppanel.py.

2006-02-02  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.4: Rearranged file to make more sense
	- no visible change.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.23: Added HACKALERT about C
	pointer version of DivisiveHebbian.

	* topo/tests/testlissom_cpointer.ty 1.3: Cleaned up connecitions
	(removed connection_params, but also sharedweight projection
	code). Added a HACKALERT.

	* examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.20, examples/som_retinotopy.ty

	examples/hierarchical.ty 1.26, examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.26: Made
	syntax to specificy connections simpler by removing
	'connection_params' and using a dictionary of keywords. Left a
	note by Simulator.connect() about adding a dictionary back in for
	extra parameters should they later be required.

2006-02-02  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorial/.cvsignore 1.2: More to ignore

	* topo/commands/lineplotting.py 1.6: Reduced default topographic
	grid figure size

	* doc/shared/util.php 1.17: Added alert

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.75, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.36:
	Added an alert

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.52: Fixed typo

	* doc/Reference_Manual/index_text.php 1.4: Added explanation of
	why to read or avoid this manual

	* doc/Future_Work/index_text.php 1.7: Added notes from meetings,
	etc.

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.14: Added note about CVS

2006-02-01  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.14,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py 1.11,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testbasicplotgrouppanel.py 1.3,
	topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.12,
	topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.21, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py
	1.30: Renamed BasicPlotGroupPanel to TemplatePlotGroupPanel.

2006-02-01  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.14: Tidied and some of the methods
	written a little nicer.

2006-02-01  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.23, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.79, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.29: Renamed
	UnitWeightsPlotGroup to ConnectionFieldsPlotGroup, for consistency
	with the template name. Nevertheless, I realised that it might be
	confusing from a developper point of view: the concept of CF is
	different that the weights of a unit, i.e. we can have sheets with
	no CF and still vizualize the weights of a unit.

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.25, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.29:
	Renamed the Connection Field template to Connection Fields
	(plural).

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.19: Deleted two old ALERTS and wrote
	a new one.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.74, topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.22,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.78, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py
	1.31, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.28, topo/plotting/bitmap.py
	1.22: Replaced the Bitmap's view_info attribute by a name and
	plot_src_name attributes; they are copies of the plot's attributes
	of the same name. Now, the string that has to be displayed is
	built from these two attributes in PlotGroupPanel's
	display_labels(). The UnitWeightPanel() display_labels method has
	to be modified: connection fields panel and projection's panel do
	not handle labels as a normal BasicPlotGroupPanel.

2006-02-01  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.2: Changed V1's density to
	48. Changed CFSheet's density to 24. Connected on and off LGN
	sheets to V1, though not properly.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.8: If a unit is near the sheet edge,
	the shared weights matrix will not necessarily be the right matrix
	- the correct submatrix is needed. Added code to do that.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.103: Changed the function that
	was for slicing the mask matrix to one that returns the slice.

2006-02-01  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.73, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.77:
	Replaced the Plot attribute view_info (a dict) by a single
	plot_src_name. It has still to be changed in future commit.

	* topo/tests/testplot.py 1.15, topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.22,
	topo/tests/testsheetview.py 1.9, topo/base/connectionfield.py
	1.102, topo/base/sheetview.py 1.9, topo/commands/analysis.py 1.10,
	topo/plotting/plot.py 1.72, topo/projections/basic.py 1.7: Deleted
	the attribute view_info of a SheetView, replaced by a single
	src_name attribute. Deleted the parameter view_type that wasn't of
	any use. Also added two ALERT in sheetview.py that will have to be
	examined.

2006-02-01  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.16: Added performance
	profiling code examples back in (they're commented out).

2006-02-01  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.25, examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.25:
	Corrected the learning rate now that the HebbianSOMLF function
	does not use the constant_sum_connection_rate() anymore.

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.14: Adapted the min radius to be
	set like in the book (0.5/40 in sheet coordinates), now that there
	is a crop_radius. It gives a good result (with the same parameters
	than in the book: 40 units and so on...), but I did not compared
	it with our previous result with a radius of 1.25/40.

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.13: Made the simulation use the new
	C coded CFEuclideanDistance() function; also corrected the
	generator sheet density to be 24 (it has been committed with a
	value of 40, by mistake). Also got rid of unused commented out
	code.

	* topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.2: C version of the
	CFEuclideanDistance reponse function. It is mostly based on the C
	version of CFDotProduct().It does seem to be about 1.5 times
	faster (when it took 1mn it now takes 40s). It could probably be
	even faster (as well as the CFDotProduct() C version, I think) but
	would need more work.

2006-01-31  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/palette.py 1.7: Started an implementation of the
	String-Based Palette class. It is just committed for my
	convenience, but there is nothing finished at all; it shouldn't
	affect anything to commit it though.

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.12, topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.39:
	Fixed afferent learning rate scaling for SOMs; i.e, don't need
	scaling at all for this learning function.  Changed the
	crop_radius for the neighborhood function to have a minimum
	radius, to ensure that it covers at least a neighboring unit in
	each direction

2006-01-31  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_oo_or.ty 1.1: Initial version -
	incomplete. Based on lissom_or.ty, but with circular
	connectionfields.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.6: Updated SharedWeightCFProjection
	to match changes in connectionfield and cfprojection. Not yet
	tested.

	* topo/tests/or_map_topo.log 1.4: 20009 iterations from c++
	lissom.

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.15: Updated learning rates
	to correct ones from lissom_or.ty before it was split into
	lissom_or.ty and lissom_or_reference.ty. THey were lost when
	lissom_or_reference was reverted to 21st December 2005 code.

2006-01-30  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.14: Back to the previous
	network size (BaseN=72).

	* topo/tests/or_map_topo.log 1.3: 200 iterations from c++ lissom

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.13: Using a smaller network.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.101,
	topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.12: Altered some hackalerts.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.100: Mask centered on matrixidx
	center.

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.18: Added hack to remove Random
	Generator from the list of PatternGenerators in the test pattern
	window. But it will still appear in other menus.

2006-01-30  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* ChangeLog 1.3: Updated with recent changes

2006-01-30  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.99, topo/learningfns/basic.py
	1.38, topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.22: Renamed the
	single_connection_learning_rate() to
	constant_sum_connection_rate(); it indicates that the learning
	rate is scaled based on keeping the sum constant,which leaving it
	open for adding other types of connection_rate() functions.

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.21, topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.35:
	Modified featuremap so that in the case of a cyclic value the
	preference matrix is normalized, but not in the case of a
	non-cyclic value. It solves the problem of the position preference
	plot shrinking when increasing the range of values. Though it
	might be an alright reasoning, an hack alert has been added in
	FeatureMap and in bitmap.py, because it made me realised that if
	this normalization is not performed for a sheetview that will be
	used as the hue key in an HSV plot, an error will occur in
	bitmap. Therefore, we should think about this case, and decide
	what to do to avoid unexpected errors in the future.

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.9: Corrected a mistyped parenthesis.

2006-01-30  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.98: Mask is resized by
	change_bounds() in a way that is consistent with how it's
	generated in the first place. Not sure if it's the right way
	though - these changes have not yet been verified (but the
	resizing is better than before, in any case).

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.97: ConnectionField.__init__()'s
	mask creation code is moved to a subroutine.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.96: Moved CFProjection's mask
	creation code to a subroutine.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.95: weight_type no longer an
	attribute of CFProjection (and no longer passed to
	ConnectionField). Instead, it's a global variable.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.94: Corrected variable name error
	in previous commit. Updated a HACKALERT.

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.11: Changed to circular
	ConnectionFields.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.93: Mask pattern is generated in
	CFProjection and passed to each ConnectionField. A ConnectionField
	takes the correct submatrix of this mask (which is all of the
	mask, unless it is near an edge. The way this is done needs to be
	simplified, but is currently working. The size calculated for a
	mask that is e.g. a Disk does not appear to be correct.

2006-01-30  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/random.py 1.18: Made RandomGenerator base class to
	make it simpler to add other Random classes.  Added GaussianRandom

2006-01-29  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.11: Cleaned up comments

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.10: Changed density to match
	lissombook

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.37: Changed crop_radius_multiplier
	to match fm2d; will make simulations much slower but much more
	likely to work.  Also added commented-out print function printing
	parameters in the format of fm2d

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.36: Added radius_crop_multiplier.
	Shouldn't have changed the behavior at all yet.

2006-01-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.92: Corrected mistake in previous
	version.

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.24, topo/base/connectionfield.py
	1.91: Masks are setup with the size of the
	weights_bounds_template. This is an intermediate checkin for how
	it will work, but the specification of the weights_shape at the
	user level code won't change. hierarchical contains a
	commented-out example.

2006-01-29  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.9: Cleaned up comments and
	documentation

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.35: Fixed to match recent change in
	definition of Gaussian PatternGenerator size

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.24: Added CoG plot

	* topo/commands/lineplotting.py 1.5: Added user-controllable
	sheet_view names for x and y preferences in topographic_grid.
	Suppressed annoying plotting display glitch.

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.8: Added measure_cog function.
	Added user-controllable x_range and y_range parameters to
	measure_position_pref.

	* topo/base/arrayutils.py 1.3: Added centroid function written by
	Julien

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.22: Improved CFEuclideanDistance_Py

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.51: Added alert

2006-01-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.90: initialize_slice_array()
	changed to initialize_bounds(). initialize_bounds() takes the
	centered bounds, converts them to a slice at the origin of the
	sheet, then translates that slice to the cf's location, and
	finally stores the corresponding bounding box (and slice_array
	for access by C). Removed set_slice_array().

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.59: Removed a CEBHACKALERT,
	which was out of date.

2006-01-29  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.52: Changed name of height and width
	for gaussian and gabor to xsigma and ysigma, to avoid confusion
	(since they are radii and not actual widths and heights)

	* doc/Reference_Manual/index_text.php 1.3: Minor updates

	* topo/misc/patternfns.py 1.2: Changed name of height and width
	for gaussian and gabor to xsigma and ysigma, to avoid confusion
	(since they are radii and not actual widths and heights)

2006-01-29  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.21: Added a class TemplateFile
	to plotfilesaver. It is just a first try for implementing
	plotfilesaver. Just committed for my convenience (i.e. beeing able
	to work on it at the office.)

2006-01-28  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.11: Corrected scipy install
	command.

2006-01-28  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.20, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.76, topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.13,
	topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.20: Renamed BasicPlotGroup to
	TemplatePlotGroup.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.51: Changed the default size value for
	the Gaussian to be 0.5 (to match recent changes in Gaussian size
	definition).

	* topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.19,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.30, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.17,
	topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.19, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.75, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.35,
	topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.27: Changed the hierarchy of the
	PlotGroup classes: now PlotGroup is a simpler class that works by
	passing it a plot_list of plots, while BasicPlotGroup (soon to be
	renamed TemplatePlotGroup) implements the generation of the
	plot_list according to a template specification; others PlotGroup
	classes now inherit from BasicPlotGroup.

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.24, examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.8,
	topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.10, topo/tests/testlissom.ty
	1.10, topo/tests/testlissom_cpointer.ty 1.2, examples/lissom_or.ty
	1.59, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.19, topo/patterns/basic.py
	1.50: Modified the size parameter for a Gaussian so that it
	corresponds to the real size (and it is consistent with the
	definition of the size for,e.g. a disk or rectangle). The width of
	the Gaussian (sigma) corresponds to half the size.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.50: Updated doc for slice2bounds().

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.7: Added some commentary; working
	version for switching from CFDotProduct to CFEuclideanDistance_Py
	response function. Left with a density of 10, used during testing.

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.21: First version of an
	euclidean-distance response function. This is supposed to be used
	by the som_retinotopy example, but did not allow to achieve the
	expected result yet.

2006-01-28  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.89: Removed line left in by
	mistake in the previous commit.

2006-01-28  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.13: Changed line about Windows
	install to use CVS

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.10: added that scipy_core is
	already in external

2006-01-28  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.71: Restored situate, but haven't
	checked it's correct.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.49: Added initial version of Slice object;
	currently unused and untested.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.49: Simplified a little - nobody would
	be passing in pattern_x and pattern_y as parameters.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.43, topo/base/topoobject.py 1.18: A
	TopoObject is 'uninitialized' until its __init__() method
	completes. A Constant Parameter can be set on an uninitialized
	TopoObject.

2006-01-27  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.70: slice2matrixshape() removed and
	replaced with current functions from sheet (bounds2slice() with
	crop_slice_to_sheet_bounds),

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.48, topo/patterns/image.py 1.26,
	topo/patterns/random.py 1.17, topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.21,
	topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.88, topo/base/patterngenerator.py
	1.58: PatternGenerator no longer takes slice_array from
	ConnectionField. Now, it is passed the ConnectionField's bounds
	and x and y location. PatternGenerator still evaluates the pattern
	in the center rather than at the ConnectionField's
	location. bounds2slice()-type functions are tidied up a bit in
	sheet. lissom_or_reference behavior is unchanged.

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.9: Updated to current
	Topographica code (had been setup for 2005/12/21 code). Actual
	tests commented out.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.69: Accidentally checked in a
	half-finished version previously.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.68: Changed to work with different
	functions in sheet.py. The changes will probably need updating
	after work on sheet.py is finished.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.87, topo/base/sheet.py 1.47: No
	visible changes. Removed bounds2shape(). Temporary modification to
	bounds2slice() allowing it to skip cropping the slice to the
	sheet. Temporarily added slice2matrixshape(). ConnectionField
	temporarily modified so its behavior is unchanged.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.25: Removed use of bounds2shape()
	function. Image is now broken, but does not cause errors. To be
	fixed after modification of sheet.py is finished.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.20: Commented-out bounds2shape()
	tests. They will be replaced with an equivalent test.

	* topo/tests/testlissom.ty 1.9: CFDotProduct moved to
	topo/responsefns/optimized.py

2006-01-27  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.9: Added Id tag

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.8: Minor updates

2006-01-26  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.13: Removed an import that was
	preventing the tests from running.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.46: Temporary hack (I'm sorry) in
	bounds2shape() to get round a problem (which only occurs for some
	bounds and densities) in bounds2slice() - I think it's a floating
	point issue.

2006-01-26  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.7: Extensive revision to
	directions, turned into steps, and Weave is now more of a natural
	part of the installation process.

2006-01-26  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.19: Added a test that involves the
	kind of situation that exists in creating a connection field. The
	test fails because bounds2shape() returns the wrong shape. Is the
	problem a floating point issue?

2006-01-26  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.15, topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py
	1.12: Activity of a sheet can be displayed in the Editor,
	upsidedown..

2006-01-26  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/lineplotting.py 1.4: Added ALERT

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.10: This version was
	self-organized again, instead of just editing the file to change
	the path (though that seemed to work fine)

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.9: Moved inlinec-dependent
	functions from responsefns/basic.py to responsefns/optimized.py

2006-01-26  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.67: Added doc for _normalize() and
	_situate_plot().

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.66: Corrected normalize again: in case
	of a negative or zero constant, a zero matrix is returned; in case
	of a positive value, a one matrix is returned.

2006-01-26  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.7: Fixed docstring

2006-01-26  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.65: Corrected _normalize() so that it
	returns a one matrix in case of a constant.

2006-01-26  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.23, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.23,
	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.58, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.18,
	examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.6, topo/projections/optimized.py
	1.13, topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.12, topo/responsefns/basic.py
	1.20, topo/responsefns/optimized.py 1.1: Moved inlinec-dependent
	functions from basic.py to optimized.py

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.21: Minor documentation cleanup

2006-01-25  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* ChangeLog 1.2: Updated with recent changes

	* topo/commands/lineplotting.py 1.3: Enforced minimum size of
	topographic map plots

2006-01-25  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.6, topo/plotting/templates.py 1.23:
	Changed the name of the template CoG Preference to be Position
	Preference. Also changed measure_cog() to be named
	measure_position_pref().

2006-01-25  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.34: Added question about proper
	scaling for a SOM learning rate

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.36: Added tsettle alert

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.22, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.22,
	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.57, examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.5:
	Changed all parameter files to remove initial iteration so that
	the user can inspect an untrained network

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.42: Added alert

	* doc/shared/util.php 1.16: Minor tweak

2006-01-25  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.45: bounds2shape() uses bounds2slice() to
	get the matrix shape.

	* topo/patterns/random.py 1.16, topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.86,
	topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.57: PatternGenerator no longer
	uses bounds2shape(); instead, it uses bounds2slice(). If the slice
	is already known, it can be passed in (as an optimization, like
	rows and cols could be passed in before). There should be no
	visible changes.

2006-01-25  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.4: Corrected an error in last
	commit.

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.3: Version that appears to match
	the parameter in the book, but still does not give the expected
	results with Topographica.

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.5: Improved the code in
	PatternPresenter: now use the __setattr__ method rather than an
	exec to update the pattern generator attributes.

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.2: Adjusted the parameters to match
	the simulation in the book.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.74: Minor cleaning.

2006-01-24  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.12, doc/Downloads/win32_text.php
	1.6: Updated documentation for Windows port

2006-01-24  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/__init__.py 1.7: Deleted plotengine from the
	plotting/__init__.py file.

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.22: Cleaned up old alerts.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.29: Cleaned up comments and old
	alerts.

2006-01-24  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* external/win32/setup.py 1.22: Added header information about the
	different steps within setup.py

	* external/win32/README.txt 1.4: Moved what the code in setup.py
	does, into setup.py

2006-01-24  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.18,
	topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.11, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py
	1.34, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.16, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py
	1.28, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.26,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.28: Deleted the parameter
	plotgroup_type and plotgroup_key when creating a PlotGroupPanel.

2006-01-24  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/misc/inlinec.py 1.4, topographica_script.py 1.20: Changed
	direction of importing.  Lowercased variable.

2006-01-24  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.27: Re-organized import
	statements.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.64: Added the normalizing for the
	RGBPlot.

	* topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.10: Got rid of unused default
	value.

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.21: Deleted the normalize field in
	the plot_templates. Now, normalize is only specified for a
	PlotGroupTemplate.

	* topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.18, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.73, topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.17,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.26, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py
	1.33, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.15,
	topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.25: Added a parameter normalize
	to be passed to a PlotGroup. Now the information normalize is no
	longer passed through the template but rather by modifying the
	PlotGroup.normalize attribute.

2006-01-24  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.44: bounds2slice() always returns int
	values.

2006-01-24  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.16,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.32, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py
	1.24, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.25: Renamed the
	PlotGroupPanel attribute plot_group to plot_group_title.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.24: Started a re-organization of
	the file. Moved code around to made it clearer. Added alert about
	how to improve the file, and take the normalize information from
	the template rather than the first plot_template. (This has been
	tested with version 1.42 of sheet.py because the new version 1.43
	has introduced an error in the slicing of the sheetviews.)

2006-01-24  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.43: bounds2slice() returns the slice that
	includes all units whose centres are within the specified bounds
	(and within the sheet's bounds).

2006-01-24  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.17, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.72, topo/plotting/templates.py 1.20,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.31: Got rid of the now un-used
	Density and Projection_name fields in the Projection
	PlotGroupTemplate.

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.4: Omitted in previous commit:
	changed the name of update_weights() to update_connectionfields().

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.27, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py
	1.23, topo/plotting/templates.py 1.19: Renamed the Unit Weights
	template to Connection Field; made the corresponding change in
	topoconsole. Also modified the way labels is display from the
	UnitWeightsPanel to display the name of the template (as it is
	defined in templates.py). I think we might renamed
	UnitWeightsPanel to ConnectionFieldPanel, it has to be decided.

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.18: Added a function
	new_plotgroup_template to create and store a
	PlotGroupTemplate. Renamed add_plot_template() to add_plot(), and
	re-write all the template creation using new_plotgroup_template()
	and add_plot().

2006-01-23  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.56: Added a note about the input_bounds.

2006-01-23  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.21: Added a comment to explain how to
	find the learning rate.

	* examples/som_retinotopy.ty 1.1: Added the skeleton for the
	retinotopic map simulation. It has to be modifiedf so that the
	parameters exactly match the simulation published in the book.

2006-01-23  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.14: 1st receptive field in centre
	and labels are closer to middle.

2006-01-23  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testlissom.ty 1.8: Added test for activity matrix
	size.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.85: No visible change for
	networks that use weight generators like COnstat() or
	UniformRandom(): weights patterns drawn at the center of the sheet
	rather than at the ConnectionField's x and y location (as used to
	be the case).

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.42: No visible change. Removed redundant
	'maxrow+1', clarified 'toprow+1'. Cleaned up docstring.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.41: No visible change. Altered variable
	names in bounds2slice().

2006-01-22  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.17: Made initial state be clean

	* topo/commands/lineplotting.py 1.2: Minor tweaks

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.3: Removed temporary plot_cog()
	command

	* topo/commands/lineplotting.py 1.1, topo/plotting/templates.py
	1.17, topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.15: Added
	topographic_grid plot

	* topo/commands/analysis.py 1.2: Temporary commit to preserve
	octave-based topographic-grid plotting; requires external command
	topogrid in ./external/

	* topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.12, topo/commands/analysis.py
	1.1, topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.14,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.30, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py
	1.22: Moved topo/analysis/updatecommands to topo/commands/analysis

	* doc/Developer_Manual/imports_text.php 1.2: Minor tweak

	* topo/base/arrayutils.py 1.2: Added octave_str and octave_output
	commands

	* doc/Future_Work/index_text.php 1.6: Added link to pymat

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.16: Added a few notes

2006-01-20  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.40: Added a comment about a
	JABALERT./topographica -g examples/cfsom_or.ty I need Jim's advise
	before getting rid of it.

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.15: Wrote an add_plot_template()
	function in PlotGroupTemplate in order to create them more
	conveniently. I did not change the current way templates are
	defined because I am waiting for Jim reviewing the function and
	confirming it is OK.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.39, topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.11,
	topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.18, topo/tests/testsheetview.py 1.8,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py 1.10: Got rid of
	add_sheet_view() in Sheet now that the sheet_view_dict is public.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.17: Wrote a slice2bounds test. Now
	there is a pretty heavy testing of: bounds2slice,slice2bounds and
	also slice2bounds_to_bounds2slice (that test that both function
	combined together provide an identity function).

2006-01-20  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.11: Fixed a few wee bugs in the
	popup menu.

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.13, topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py
	1.10: Add order to objects drawn in the canvas. Allow for order to
	be changed, in popup menu.

2006-01-20  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.16: Finished to write the test for
	bounds2slice. I think it is enough testing for this function now.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.84, topo/base/sheet.py 1.38:
	Modified slice2bounds and bounds2slice so that the bounds returned
	by slice2bounds do not have any additional margins; the margin is
	now built internally to bounds2slice, and therefore slice2bounds
	return the exact bounds. I had to slightly (and temporarily,
	because Chris is still working on it) modified connectionfield.py.

2006-01-19  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.12, topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.7,
	topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.9: All possible import * occurrences
	omitted

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.11: Ok button added to objects
	properties window. Updates and closes.

2006-01-19  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.83: No visible change. Altered
	call to ConnectionField.__init__().

2006-01-18  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.10: Lateral Connections colour
	when they have the focus.

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.9: Connections from a sheet from
	one neuron. Lateral connection ovals can be selected and their
	properties obtained. Labels highlight when their object is
	selected and they sit (right justified) on the left of their
	object.

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.8: Order of boundary search changed
	to allow lateral connections to be selected.

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.6: More distinct display of focus

2006-01-18  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/misc/inlinec.py 1.3, topographica_script.py 1.19: Make
	loading weave on Windows non-default

	* external/win32/setup.py 1.21: Now uses Python 2.4.2

	* external/win32/python-2.4.2.msi 1.1: Upgrade Python 2.4 to 2.4.2

	* setup.bat 1.10: Upgrade Python 2.4.2 for Windows

2006-01-18  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.41: Added ALERT

	* doc/shared/util.php 1.15: Converted CONVENTIONS into a developer
	manual

	* doc/Future_Work/index_text.php 1.5: Added Judith's suggestion

	* CONVENTIONS 1.22, doc/Developer_Manual/.cvsignore 1.1,
	doc/Developer_Manual/communication_text.php 1.1,
	doc/Developer_Manual/gui_text.php 1.1,

	into a developer manual

2006-01-18  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.23: Changed the code for toggle
	normalize so that it just regenerate the normalized plots but not
	re-run the do_plot command.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.63: Changed the code for normalizing,
	introduced an offset so that the minimum value of the matirx is
	zero.

2006-01-18  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.82: Weight (and mask) patterns
	are setup using the bounds as calculated by
	initialize_slice_array(). This corrects the weights near the edges
	of sheets. There should be no visible change to simulations that
	were using a weights_generator or weights_shape that was a
	pattern such as UniformRandom() or Constant() (as opposed to a
	Disk() or Gaussian(), which were being incorrectly calculated at
	the edge of Sheets).

2006-01-18  louisem  <louisem@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.16: Cleaned up alpha and radius;
	might work now.  Enabled DivisiveSumNormalize

2006-01-18  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topographica_script.py 1.18: Undid previous change -
	commandline.py is in topo/misc/, not topo/base/.

2006-01-18  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topographica_script.py 1.17: Someone missed this file when they
	moved commandline.py

2006-01-17  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.15: Added a partial test of
	bounds2slice(). I think bounds2slice() might be incorrect - needs
	to be investigated (I might be confused).

2006-01-17  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.14: Replaced testing version of RGB
	plot with a real RGB CoG plot

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.34: Cleaned up imports and minor
	spelling errors.  Cleaned up commented-out display functions, and
	Julien made them work with the current version of the GUI (though
	they still aren't clean enough to leave uncommented). Fixed
	non-cyclic features to use an inclusive frange.

	* topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.11: Added measure_cog command

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.53: Added inclusive option to frange

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.26: Added hack useful for
	MeasureFeatureMap

	* topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.10: Expanded HACKALERT
	description

	* topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.9: Changed
	SineGratingPresenter to be a general PatternPresenter class that
	accepts any PatternGenerator

	* topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.8: Changed measure_or_pref to
	accept a presenter object instead of a presenter class

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.33,
	topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.7: Moved sim argument out of
	SineGratingPresenter __init__ and put it in __call__ instead

	* external/Makefile 1.30: Fixed bug in previous commit

	* topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.6, topo/commands/basic.py
	1.18, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.14: Removed unused sim argument
	in pattern_present

	* external/Makefile 1.29: Forced matplotlib to be remade when
	Python changes, because it seems to require that

	* ChangeLog 1.1: Up-to-date version of changes

2006-01-17  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.8: Minor correction plus put
	back RN=32.0 in case that's the problem.

2006-01-16  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testplotgrouppanel.py 1.5: Directly access the
	Sheet.sheet_view_dict, instead of the add_sheet_view function the
	SheetViews. The function add_sheet_view will be soon deleted when
	all similar calls (in other files) will have been replaced.

	* topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.5: Directly access the
	Sheet.sheet_view_dict, instead of the add_sheet_view function to
	store the Activity sheetviews. The function add_sheet_view will be
	soon deleted when all similar calls (in other files) will have
	been replaced.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.32: Directly access the
	Sheet.sheet_view_dict, instead of the add_sheet_view function to
	store the feature preference and selectivity sheetviews. The
	function add_sheet_view will be soon deleted when all similar
	calls (in other files) will have been replaced.

2006-01-16  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.7: Added test for weights.

	* topo/tests/or_map_topo.000001p000.Eye0_Activity.matrix 1.2,
	topo/tests/or_map_topo.000001p000.Primary_Activity.matrix 1.2: For
	or_map_topo.param v.1.6

	*
	topo/tests/or_map_topo.000001.wts.Primary.Afferent0.024_070.matrix
	1.1,
	topo/tests/or_map_topo.000001.wts.Primary.LateralExcitatory.024_070.matrix
	1.1: C++ LISSOM values from or_map_topo.param version 1.6

2006-01-16  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.4,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.29: Added a parameter proj_name to
	set before calling update_projection(), so that we only request
	UnitView for a given projection.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.81: Corrected Unit_View in
	CFSheet so that it only installs UnitView in the sheet_view_dict
	but does not do any look_up or does not return any UnitView
	object. Also added a test for making sure that we request UnitView
	from CFProjections only, and added the possibility to pass a
	projection name to only request UnitViews from the requested
	projection (or for all of them if projection_name == None).

	* topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.16: Got rid of the call to
	PlotGroup do_plot_cmd that no longer exists. It has to be replaced
	by a call to update_projection, but it will be done when
	re-writing entirely PlotFileSaver.

	* topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.28: Got rid of the now un-used
	attribute shape and corresponding ALERT! (It has been forgotten in
	the last commit.)

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.71: Cleaned up old ALERTS: got rid
	of the unused FLAT constant and PlotGroup shape attribute, deleted
	PlotGroup do_plot_cmd() that is now unused.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.70, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py
	1.27: Replaced generate_coords() in ProjectionPlotGroup and made
	it non-private so that it is callable from the
	projectionpanel.py. It enables to keep executing the
	updatecommands.update_projection() from the projectionpanel.

2006-01-16  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Future_Work/index_text.php 1.4: Minor clarifications, plus
	added Eyal notes

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.11: Fixed the explanation of
	upgrading to the very latest release

	* CONVENTIONS 1.21: Added section about ALERTs

2006-01-15  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.6: To match C++ LISSOM's
	samples/or_map_topo.param version 1.6. This version is for
	Topographica as of 2005/12/21 00:00. It will be updated for the
	current version of Topographica as testing proceeds from that date
	in December.

	* topo/tests/or_map_topo.000001p000.Eye0_Activity.matrix 1.1,
	topo/tests/or_map_topo.000001p000.Primary_Activity.matrix 1.1:
	From C++ LISSOM's samples/or_map_topo.param version 1.6

	* topo/tests/lissom_log_parser.py 1.2: Added function to read in
	C++ LISSOM .matrix file.

	* topo/tests/or_map_topo.log 1.2: Values from C++ LISSOM's
	or_map_topo.param version 1.6

2006-01-14  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.55: Added a scheduled action deleted by
	mistake on a previous commit.

2006-01-14  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.54: Minor cleanup; shouldn't have
	affected results

2006-01-14  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.53: Rounded the value assigned to the
	input learning rate for the scheduled actions (left temporary
	comments with original values).

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.52: Rounded the value assigned to the
	excitatory learning rate for the scheduled action (left temporary
	comment with original values).

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.51: Rounded the initial values of the
	three learning rates (input, exc, inh).

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.50: Got rid of a scheduled action that
	had no effect on the simulation.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.49: Rounded the numerical value for
	declaring the inhibitory weights bounding box.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.48: Rounded the numerical value for
	declaring the afferent weights bounding box.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.47: Rounded the numerical value for
	declaring the Gaussian size parameter.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.46: Rounded the value for declaring the
	input_bounds. Also replaced the fraction for declaring the
	Gaussian size by its numerical expression.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.45: Changed expression written as
	fraction to replace them by the numerical expression as they are
	calculated by Python. Next step is to round these values and still
	have a valid simulation.

2006-01-13  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.5: Skips first C++ LISSOM
	input pattern...which C++ LISSOM skips also?

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.4: Corrected conversion from
	C++ LISSOM's cx and cy. retina_edge_buffer set to match C++
	LISSOM's - might not be correct.

2006-01-13  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.8: Lateral projections represented
	as dotted circles; labels appear when hovered over and properties
	set through the projection's sheet. In bounds calculations are
	determined using full extent of parallelogram or receptive
	field. Multiple connections have a representation, however labels
	need sorted.

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.7: Correction to the import code
	(doesn't connect connections twice).

2006-01-13  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.3: weights_generator is
	Constant().

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.2: Takes input pattern
	parameters from a C++ lissom log file.

	* topo/tests/lissom_log_parser.py 1.1: Used to parse .log files
	from lissom and return input parameters.

	* topo/tests/or_map_topo.log 1.1: Initial verison of log file from
	C++ LISSOM's or_map_topo.params. This initial version is just to
	setup the testing.

	* topo/tests/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.1,
	examples/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.3: Moved from examples/ to
	topo/tests/

2006-01-12  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testlissom.data 1.4: Data from 2006/01/09 1315

	* topo/tests/testlissom.ty 1.7: Added comment about changing the
	reference data.

	* topo/tests/testlissom.data 1.3: Added as binary

	* topo/tests/testlissom.data 1.2: Removed - file should have been
	added as binary.

	* topo/tests/testlissom.ty 1.6: Made afferent_weights_bounds
	larger. Test cases bound to fail right now until the test
	activities are updated.

2006-01-12  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.2: Commented what are the
	number added to match the old simulation now that the learning
	rate is divided by the number of unit of the CF at the center.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.80: Deleted old JCALERT.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.79, topo/learningfns/basic.py
	1.33, topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.20: Delered the parameter
	rows and cols that were passed to
	CFLearningFunction.single_connection_learning_rate(), they are now
	retrieved from the cfs parameter instead of being passed.

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.32, topo/learningfns/optimized.py
	1.19, topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.78: Changed the name of
	set_learning_rate() to single_connection_learning_rate() in
	CFLearningFunction, and wrote the documentation for this
	function. Also changed the parameter single_cf_learning_rate to be
	single_connection_learning_rate in all sub-classes of
	CFLearningFunction. Got rid of old JABALERT about the learning
	rate handling.

2006-01-12  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testlissom.ty 1.5: Updated to use pickled data file
	testlissom.data.

	* topo/tests/testlissom.data 1.1: Pickled data for use with the
	test file. Data from release_0_8_1.

	* topo/tests/testlissom.ty 1.4: Was running with slightly
	different results each time. I have no idea why - the random and
	RandomArray seeds were set. I replaced all the lissom code again
	and it seems to run with the same results every time now. Test
	values to follow...

2006-01-12  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.44: Cleaned up the new lissom_or.ty.

2006-01-12  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testlissom.ty 1.3: The previous commit contained
	incorrect activity arrays.

	* topo/tests/testlissom.ty 1.2: Test values come from
	release_0_8_1.

2006-01-12  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.43: New version of lissom_or.ty without
	any old Lissom parameters explicilty declared. This version
	matches exactly the old one (which is now saved as
	lissom_or_reference.ty.

	* examples/lissom_or_reference.ty 1.1: The former lissom_or.ty
	file has been renamed lissom_or_reference.ty.The former
	lissom_or.ty will be replaced by a simpler version that won't
	declare any of the old Lissom parameters.

2006-01-12  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testlissom.ty 1.1: Rough initial version.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.18: Had to add a hack for
	detection of zero in the mask values. Removed a stray '*' (that
	was having no effect).

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.17: Corrected a mistake in the
	previous version of DivisiveHebbian where even unmasked values
	were used to calculate the total weight change. Made application
	of the mask simpler and more efficient by doing it in the same
	loop as the weight modification. Added HACKALERT about how to
	make the code clearer.

2006-01-12  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testmatplotlibtk.py 1.2: Tried to make the test
	be skipped when there is no display, but without any apparent
	effect

	* doc/User_Manual/index_text.php 1.5: Added note about citations

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.10: Cleaned up Mac instructions

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.77: Cleaned up comments

2006-01-11  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.76, topo/learningfns/basic.py
	1.31, topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.16: Added HACKALERT; changed
	order of output_fn and mask as a temporary solution.

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.17: Added HACKALERT

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.15: Removed code accidentally
	left behind.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.14: Minor change to
	DivisiveHebbian_CPointer C code to improve speed.

	* topo/tests/testlissom_cpointer.ty 1.1: Initial version, based on
	examples/lissom_or.ty version 1.42.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.13,
	topo/projections/optimized.py 1.12, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.35:
	LISSOM_CPointer and its various optimized functions now respects
	the mask of the weights.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.12: Corrected learning_rate
	setting in DivisiveHebbian_CPointer.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.11: Minor alteration to
	DivisiveHebbian C code to improve speed.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.10: The DivisiveHebbian C code
	now respects the mask. Added a hackalert about the name, and
	slightly changed 1 another hackalert.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.75: Made cf's mask array be the
	same type as the weights array, and made it savespace(1). Had to
	do the same on change_bounds because it appears that using
	Numeric.where() causes these attributes to be lost.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.74: Removed apparently redundant
	use of savespace(). The savespace and typecode attributes of the
	weights matrix appear to be kept anyway. If they weren't, typecode
	would need to be set again anyway.

2006-01-11  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* external/.cvsignore 1.13: Ignore Python-2.4.2 directory.

2006-01-11  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.5: Added missing import statement.

2006-01-10  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.13, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.69, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.26,
	topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.3: Moved the function
	_generate_coords() from ProjectionPlotGroup to
	ProjectionPanel. Wrote the function update_projections in
	analysis/updatecommands.py. Now this command is executed instead
	of do_plot_cmd() in ProjectionPlotGroup (that has been deleted).

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.6, topo/tests/testplotengine.py 1.18,
	topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py 1.8, topo/tests/testplotgroup.py
	1.10, topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.39,
	topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.15, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.68, topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py 1.9,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testbasicplotgrouppanel.py 1.2,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testplotgrouppanel.py 1.4,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testtopoconsole.py 1.6,
	topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.13,
	topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.9, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py
	1.22, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.25,
	topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.13, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.25,
	topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.21: Deleted plotengine.py (and
	testplotengine.py). Now, the PlotGroup objects are stored in a
	variable plotgroup_dict declared in plotgroup.py. From the panel,
	the plotgroup_dict is accessed, and if the requested PlotGroup is
	not found, it is directly created from the panel. Corresponding
	changes have been made in some test files and in PlotFileSaver.

2006-01-10  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.73: Removed line I left in by
	accident at some time in the past.

2006-01-10  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.67: Got rid of now unused
	do_plot_cmd() function in UnitWeightPlotGroup() (replaced by
	update_weights in analysis/updatecommands.py). Simplified the
	do_plot_cmd in ProjectionPlotGroup: the goal is too soon replace
	it by an update_projection command in analysis/updatecommands.py.

2006-01-10  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.72: Removed unused import
	statement.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.42, topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.71,
	topo/projections/basic.py 1.4: Moved SharedWeightProjection and
	SharedWeightCFResponseFunction from topo/base/connectionfield.py
	to topo/projections/basic.py. Renamed SharedWeightProjection to
	SharedWeightCFProjection.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.41: No visible changes (only changed
	commented-out code). LGNOn projections' output_fns set to
	DivisiveSumNormalize(). Added LGNOff. Called
	DivisiveSumNormalize() with norm_value=-1.0 where projections'
	strengths are -1.0 so that activities' signs aren't reversed. On
	and Off channels appear to work (which you can see if you
	normalize the activity in the GUI).

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.16: Added HACKALERT to
	DivisiveSumNormalize.

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.15: Removed HACKALERT. I realize now
	that although the syntax for Numeric.clip() implies it is an
	in-place operation, the array must really be copied.

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.14: Undid change in previous
	commit. Why doesn't Numeric.clip() work here?

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.30: No visible changes. Changed use
	of output_fn() so the syntax matches the in-place operation.

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.13: Used Numeric's clip() rather than
	utils.clip_in_place(). See the hackalert.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.70: No visible changes. Used
	xrange() to generate a loop instead of range(), and inside large
	loops that will run often avoided some evaluations.

2006-01-09  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.69: Added HACKALERT about
	already-known masking problem.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.40: Added dest_port to connections for
	LGNOn (change is to commented-out code, so no visible effect).

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.41: Added HACKALERT about ports.

2006-01-09  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.9: Added instructions for
	building Topographica on Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger), in the Downloads
	section of the /doc/ directory. It may have to reviewed by a
	native english speaker.

	* external/Python-2.4.tgz 1.2: remove Python-2.4.tgz from
	external/.

	* external/Makefile 1.28, external/Python-2.4.2.tgz 1.1: Replaced
	Python-2.4 by Python-2.4.2 in the external packages, and made the
	corresponding changes to the external/Makefile. This upgrade
	allows to get rid of a warning appearing in the Mac version of
	Python-2.4.

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.20, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.21,
	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.39, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.15,
	topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.68, topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.29,
	topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.9: Changed the handling of the
	learning rate: now the learning rate (as it is applied when
	passing to connectionfield.hebbian()) has been divided by the
	number of unit in the receptive field of the unit at the center of
	the sheet. The learning rate is set by a function
	set_learning_rate in CFLearningFunction, and has to be called by
	the subclasses of CFLearningFunction. Changes have been made to
	the simulation scripts in order to match the former situation,
	these changes have been heavily tested.

2006-01-08  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.67: Removed apparently unneeded
	set_cfs function. Changed base class of SharedWeightProjection to
	be CFProjection instead of Projection. Added ALERTs.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.38: Fixed radius/diameter confusion for
	circular RF masks

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.21, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py
	1.20: Added ALERTs

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.7: Changed Update to Apply, and
	added ALERT

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.37: Changed commented-out example
	SharedWeightProjection to a prototype of an ON channel

2006-01-07  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.66: Corrections to messages and
	documentation

	* topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.2: Added ALERTs

	* topo/__init__.py 1.49: Updated list for import *

2006-01-07  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.19, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.20,
	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.36, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.14:
	Added control of the input stream seed and weight stream seed for
	all the examples currently implemented. That way, the simulation
	are always similar, which enables easy testing.

	* topo/tests/testplotengine.py 1.17: Got rid of old commented out
	code in testplotengine.

2006-01-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.35: Added note about the radius of the
	afferent projection's connecttionfields.

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.18: No visible change - removed some
	commented-out code.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.34: No visible change: checked in
	commented-out code. The code is an example
	SharedWeightProjection. (Also added another note.)

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.65: SharedWeightProjection stores
	the slice indexes and bounds of units (and still just the single
	set of weights). This allows shared weight response functions to
	use the correct activity_matrix slice, and
	SharedWeightProjection.get_view() to get the correct bounds for a
	unit. The slices and bounds are stored to avoid having to
	calculate them each time e.g. a response function is called. Also
	added some hackalerts (including minor ones about code unrelated
	to that being committed here).

2006-01-06  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.12, topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py
	1.8, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.19: Changed templates.py,
	unitweightpanel.py and cfsheetpanel.py so that now it executes the
	command update_weight defines in updatecommands.py and declared in
	the UnitWeight template, instead of using the do_plot_cmd in
	UnitWeightPlotGroup.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.31,
	topo/analysis/updatecommands.py 1.1,
	topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.12: Moved the updatecommands
	(e.g. update_activity), from featuremap.py to a new file
	updatecommands.py in the analysis directory. Made the
	corresponding change in the import in BasicPlotGroupPanel.

2006-01-06  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.3: Cleaned up documentation

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.64, topo/base/sheet.py 1.37,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.66: Added alerts

2006-01-06  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.33: No visible change. Added
	commented-out code to allow the shape of the weights to be
	specified.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.63: ConnectionField's mask (for
	weights) has a threshold (temporarily hard-coded rather than being
	user-definable).

2006-01-06  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.62, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.65: Got
	rid of the unused function release_sheetviews both in Plot and
	PlotGroup. It has ot be re-defined if we want to re-implement this
	functionnality.

2006-01-06  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.62: Corrected a mistake (changed
	Int to Numeric.Int32).

2006-01-05  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.41: Added HACKALERT about inheritance
	of default values for Parameters.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.61: Added weights_shape to
	SharedWeightProjection.

	* examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.13: Temporarily commented line
	that sets default PatternGeneratorParameter.

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.28, topo/learningfns/optimized.py
	1.8, examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.17, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.19,
	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.32, topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.60: No
	visible change (I hope) (except the example files temporarily do
	not default to a particular PatternGenerator for e.g. the test
	pattern window) , although simulations will run a little
	slower. Added code to allow ConnectionFields to have a shape
	(CFProjection has a weights_shape Parameter). The default shape is
	Constant (i.e. the same rectangular shape as before).

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.59: Changed references to
	topo.base.patterngenerator to patterngenerator.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.58: No visible change - small
	alteration to code.

2006-01-04  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/__init__.py 1.7: Imported all LearningFunctions and
	ResponseFunctions for the GUI.

	* topo/responsefns/__init__.py 1.4: Code to populate
	ResponseFunctionParameter's range().

	* topo/learningfns/__init__.py 1.3: Code to populate
	LearningFunctionParameter's range().

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.52: Added HACKALERT about classname_repr().

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.57: Added
	LearningFunctionParameter and ResponseFunctionParameter. Made
	response_fn and learning_fn attributes into
	ResponseFunctionParameters and LearningFunctionParameters.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.7: Added a comment about using
	xrange() instead of range().

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.27: Changed height and width to size
	and aspect ratio (I missed when I made the change from height and
	width to size and aspect_ratio. Added notes about (1) specifying
	size and aspect_ratio here in the first place and (2) there being
	no warning when the non-parameter attributes height and width
	were being set (I spent a long, long time finding this bug).

2006-01-02  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.56, topo/base/sheet.py 1.36:
	Added a HACKALERT noting problems in the unlikely case of
	zero-sized or very small density matrices being specified.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.40: Added HACKALERT.

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.40: Changed output_fn to be an
	OutputFunctionParameter.

2005-12-31  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.34: Made the output_fn be an
	OutputFunctionParameter.

	* topo/__init__.py 1.48: Added HACKALERT.

	* topo/patterns/__init__.py 1.9, topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py
	1.20, topo/tkgui/__init__.py 1.6, topo/base/parameter.py 1.40,
	topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.55, topo/base/projection.py 1.39,
	topo/outputfns/__init__.py 1.5: Part-way
	checkin. ClassSelectorParameters (such as
	PatternGeneratorParameter) can now be declared in the correct file
	(topo.base.patterngenerator in this example) because the list of
	available classes (PatternGenerators in this case) is added to in
	the relevant __init__.py file (topo/patterns/__init__.py in this
	case). The list of available classes comes from the imported
	modules in the package, so the GUI does e.g. 'from topo.patterns
	import *' to make all options available. There are other
	ClassSelectorParameters still to add, and the documentation is
	incomplete.

	* topo/outputfns/__init__.py 1.4, topo/patterns/__init__.py 1.8,
	topo/patterns/basic.py 1.48, topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.39:
	Changed name of PackageParameter to ClassSelectorParameter.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.39: Changed name of PackageParameter to
	ClassSelectorParameter. Made DynamicNumber's setting error message
	slightly more informative.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.38: Commented out some currently
	unused code.

2005-12-30  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.37: Continued cleaning - no
	visible change.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.36,
	topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.17: Cleaned method arguments.

	* topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py 1.20: Added ALERT about TaggedSlider
	widths.

	* topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.16, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py
	1.19: Some simplifications.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.35: Now uses a dictionary to map
	parameters to widgets.

2005-12-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py 1.18: Cleaned up TaggedSlider (no
	visible change).

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.34,
	topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.15, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py
	1.17: Continued to cleaned up widgets in taggedslider.py (not yet
	finished). Gave the idea of 'string_translator' widgets an
	existence with a TranslatorWidget base class. We might want to
	change the name.

2005-12-28  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.33,
	topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.14, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py
	1.16: Read-only properties are displayed with a label rather than
	a read-only entry box. The label text needs to be fixed - there's
	an alert about that.

2005-12-22  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.8: Clarified updating

	* doc/shared/trailer.php 1.2: Updated web site date; not sure why
	it is not set up to update automatically

	* Makefile 1.34, doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.6: Fixed problem
	with LATEST_STABLE tagging

	* doc/Future_Work/index_text.php 1.3, doc/Home/index_text.php 1.2,

	1.8, doc/User_Manual/index_text.php 1.4, doc/shared/index.php 1.7,
	topo/misc/__init__.py 1.2, doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.5:
	Updated documentation to match latest release

	* Makefile 1.33: Minor fix

	* Makefile 1.32: Made web site depend on doc

	* Makefile 1.31: Updated release to 0.8.1

	* Makefile 1.30: Added releasing and versioning commands

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.5: Clarified toolbar labels

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.18: Set default locations for the
	Model Editor

2005-12-22  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorial/index_text.php 1.7: Changed 'layout' to
	'architecture'.

	* doc/Tutorial/index_text.php 1.6: Added picture of network from
	model editor. Removed text about edge-effects now there's a buffer
	round the retina.

	* doc/Tutorial/images/lissom_network_diagram.png 1.1: Picture of
	network from the model editor window.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.24: Image as the new name for
	ImageGenerator caused a clash...with Image. So temporarily
	Python's Image library is imported as pImage.

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.16, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.12:
	Default test pattern is a Gaussian.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.47: Adjusted default Parameter
	settings.

	* topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.10, topo/tests/testfeaturemap.py 1.9,
	topo/tests/testsheetview.py 1.7: Sheet's bounds and density cannot
	be set on an object now they are Constant parameters. Uses of
	ImageGenerator(Sheet) were setting them on an object.

	* doc/Tutorial/images/unit_weights_0.2_0.0.png 1.1,
	doc/Tutorial/images/unit_weights_0.2_0.0_or.png 1.1: Added unit
	weights plots for unit at (0.2,0.0) since it's clearly orientation
	selective.

	* doc/Tutorial/index_text.php 1.5: Added color key underneath
	colorized weights plot.

	* doc/Tutorial/index_text.php 1.4: Updated horizontal orientation
	key.

2005-12-21  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorial/images/or_key_horiz_transparent.png 1.2: Corrected
	to match topographica's orientation coloring scheme.

2005-12-21  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.18: Set situate on by default
	for UnitWeightsPanel

2005-12-21  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorial/images/activity_line.png 1.3,
	doc/Tutorial/images/activity_line_or.png 1.3,
	doc/Tutorial/images/or_map.png 1.5,
	doc/Tutorial/images/projection.png 1.5,
	doc/Tutorial/images/test_pattern.png 1.5,
	doc/Tutorial/index_text.php 1.3: Update to tutorial now that
	weights can be colorized, and with most recent map.

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.8: Updated the snapshot to have
	the model set out better in the model editor.

	* doc/Team_Members/index_text.php 1.3: Added a link to a
	soon-to-be-realized page about motion after-effects to Chris'
	section.

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.7: I trained another map. I like
	training maps. This one was for changes to the PatternGenerator
	subclass names.

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.17, topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.26,
	topo/patterns/basic.py 1.46, topo/patterns/image.py 1.23,
	topo/patterns/random.py 1.15, topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.19,

	examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.11, topo/analysis/featuremap.py
	1.30, topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.56,
	topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.54, topo/base/utils.py 1.51: The
	PatternGenerator subclasses lose the 'Generator' suffix.

	For example: " from topo.patterns.basic import LineGenerator ...
	LineGenerator() "

	has changed to: " import topo.patterns.basic ...
	topo.patterns.basic.Line() "

	This checkin was part of an approximately 10-kilometre diff, so
	the chance of a mistake somewhere is quite high.

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.6: I trained another map. I like
	training maps. This one was for changes to the way Sheet computes
	density.

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.12: Added hack to reverse the order
	of the 'present in:' buttons.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.32: 'Install as class defaults'
	button hidden for the moment.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.30: GeneratorSheet bounds are set on the
	class, as in the other examples. This makes more sense than
	setting them on the specific Retina used in this example, I think.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.31,
	topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.13, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py
	1.15: Constant parameters are displayed but cannot be edited
	(EntryEval gets a 'readonly' config option...please feel free to
	change the background color). How to deal with Constants for a
	class is left for another day...

	* topo/patterns/__init__.py 1.7: Added HACKALERT.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.35: density and bounds are Constant
	parameters.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.38: Changed Constant so that its value
	can be set on a class, but not on an object.

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.25: Removed unused import of
	Constant

	* topo/patterns/__init__.py 1.6: PatternGenerators don't have
	'Generator' cut off their name in menus. Either we rename
	PatternGenerator to Pattern (so LineGenerator to Line, and all the
	rest), or we do something like alter the name attribute of the
	PatternGenerator class. Or someone has a better idea...

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.30: Removed print statement left
	in by accident.

	* topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.12, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py
	1.14, topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.29: PropertiesFrame gets a
	checkbutton property, which is CheckbuttonEval (added to
	taggedslider.py). ParametersFrame now deals with Boolean
	Parameters.

2005-12-21  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.6, topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.6:
	Creates a window holding a ParametersFrame, when properties is
	selected from popup, or EditorObject is double clicked.

2005-12-21  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.16: Uncommented a line that was
	accidentally left commented in the previous update.

2005-12-20  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.22, topo/patterns/random.py 1.14,
	topo/plotting/plot.py 1.61, topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.14,
	topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.53, topo/base/sheet.py 1.34,
	topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.55: - Added xdensity and ydensity
	that stores the true densities along x and y to the class
	Sheet. These densities are different from the density parameter
	when the width or height of the sheet bounds multiplied by density
	is not a integer. The size of the sheet matrix will be the integer
	part of that product and therefore the real density is less than
	the parameter by no more than 1. These real densities are
	important for computing the conversion between sheet and matrix
	coordinates, which were computed in these conversion functions.

	There are two reasons for moving them into the sheet: 1) more
	efficient because the true densities are cached in Sheet 2) It
	ensure the same densities are used across all conversion functions
	and different bounds.

	- All conversion functions between matrix and sheet coordinates
	now require BOTH the true x and y densities.

2005-12-20  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.11: Removed
	TestingPanel_for_RGB_Activity for now

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.12, topo/base/sheetview.py 1.8,
	topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.20, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.60,

	1.17: Cleaned up documentation and comments

2005-12-20  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.5: Allow the editor to import
	models from the simulator. If the topo Sheets don't have gui
	coords strored, uses random numbers to position them.

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.4: Add topo sheets as they are made,
	rather than when they are connected.

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.5: Small refinements; nicer.

2005-12-20  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.52: Added a HACKALERT (which is
	a question, really).

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.5: Updated trained network after
	changes to lissom_or.ty's parameters.

2005-12-20  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.29: Changed the definition of gaussian's
	width and height, also the afferent weights.

2005-12-19  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.3: First attempt solution of
	Pmw/Tkinter Menu item clash

2005-12-19  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.15: After loading a saved network,
	GaussianGenerators are only installed in the GeneratorSheets if
	GaussianGenerator has already been imported. This is a hack of a
	hack so that a GaussianGenerator is restored to the
	GeneratorSheets in the lissom_or.ty example (but does not raise
	an error for other cases).

2005-12-19  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.4: Removed filling of CF oval, to
	eventually allow activity pattern to show through.

2005-12-19  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.16, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.28,
	topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.11: PatternGeneratorParameter.default
	should be a PatternGeneratorParameter instance, not a class.

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.14: Corrected previous commit:
	BoundingBox is now imported from topo.base.boundingregion, which
	is what I meant to type.

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.13: BoundingBox is now imported from
	topo.base.sheet instead of topo.base.patterngenerator.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.28: Added a hack to have a
	DynamicNumber not display as a DynamicNumber in a ParametersFrame
	while we figure out how to do deal with DynamicNumbers properly.

2005-12-18  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.19, topo/base/connectionfield.py
	1.54: added ConnectionField.slice_tuple() and set_slice_array() to
	simplify the code.

2005-12-18  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.10: Edited HACKALERT

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.15, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.27: Added
	a default for PatternGeneratorParameter for e.g. the GUI.

	topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.11,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.24, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py
	1.16: Got rid of now unused got for handling static plot_list in
	PlotGroup; plot_list is always a dynamic list. Fixed an hack in
	the plotgrouppanel subclasses that was relating to that.

	* topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.10,
	topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.21, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py
	1.23, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.15,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.60: Changed initialize_plot_list so
	that to only have dynamic list and still have the possibility to
	pass an already built plot_list when creating a PlotGroup. Made
	corresponding changes in the plotgrouppanel classes.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.38, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.59: Got rid of the possibility of passing lambda function as a
	filter in PlotGroup; instead always pass a string (sheet_name) or
	None, and build the corresponding lambda function in the PlotGroup
	constructor. Simplified PlotEngine accordingly.

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.10: Changed the name of the
	temporary test template for RGBPlot.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.58: Cleaned up the file by getting
	rid of old comments and alerts.

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.9: Corrected a minor error on last
	commit.

	1.22, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.24: Got rid of the PlotTemplate
	class in template. Now, a plot_template is simply a dictionary
	associated to a name in the KeyedList() plot_templates attribute
	of a PlotGroupTemplate. Coresponding changes have been made in
	some tests files, and in PlotGroup, PlotFileSaver and the
	PlotGroupPanels. I also got rid of the attribute description of a
	PlotGroupTemplate, that was a simple copy of the name attribute,
	and made the correponding changes in TopoConsole.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.57: Changed the name of HSVPlot to
	SHCPlot and of ColormapPlot to PalettePlot.

2005-12-18  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.56: Cleaned up documentation and
	comments

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.19: Cleaned up comments and
	documentation

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.18: Added counting of bad pixels

2005-12-17  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.17: Added a TO DO list.

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.16, topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py
	1.13: Changed the attribute Bitmap.bitmap to be Bitmap.image. Made
	corresponding changes on plotfilesaver.

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.15, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.55,
	topo/tests/testbitmap.py 1.6, topo/tests/testplot.py 1.14,
	topo/tests/testplotengine.py 1.14, topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py
	1.6, topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.8, topo/tests/testsheetview.py
	1.6: Got rid of an unused part of the code in RGBBitmap. Changed
	the name from HSVMap, RGBMap and ColorMap to HSVBitmap, RGBBitmap
	and PaletteBitmap. Made corresponding changes in plot and
	testfiles.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.54: Modified __slice_matrices() and
	moved it from HSVPlot to Plot. It is now a simple routine that
	only works on one matrix.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.53: Cleaned up doc and comments.

2005-12-16  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.26,
	topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.10, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py
	1.12, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.8,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testpropertiesframe.py 1.7,
	topo/patterns/__init__.py 1.5, topo/base/parameter.py 1.37:
	Continued modification of parametersframe and propertiesframe, and
	associated files. Particularly, the way testpattern works is
	changing. Some changes are here so that things carry on working
	during the reorganization; nevertheless, the ability to choose
	whether or not a generatorsheet's preview window is updated in the
	test pattern window is temporarily gone. Most of the methods
	involved in presenting patterns in the test pattern window are
	already subject to JABHACKALERTS.

2005-12-16  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.52: Added the call to TopoObject
	__init__ from Plot. Allowed to get rid of the parameter name in
	Plot and passing it as a TopoObject param. Also get rid of default
	value for Plot subclasses RGBPlot and ColormapPlot.

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.14, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.51:
	Eliminated redundant clipping. Now it only clips in
	Bitmap._arrayToImage() if the value are over 255. No other
	clipping is performed before. Also eliminated unused part of the
	code (e.G. attribute cropped in Plot, normalizing in
	_arrayToImage).

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.50: Cleaned up the doc. Got rid of the
	matrix_hsv_to_rgb() (it was supposed to be done on my last
	commit... it is now). Got rid of unused default value in
	Plot.__init__. Changed the name of a parameter from resu to plot.

	* topo/tests/testplot.py 1.13, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.49,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.56: Changed Plot so that it has an
	attribute Bitmap, rather than a three tuple of rgb_matrices. From
	PlotGroup, the bitmap is directly taken, without having to worry
	about which kind of Bitmap it is (i.e. HSV,RGB or Pallette), the
	different case beeing handled within Plot without anyone having to
	know about it from outside. The TestPlot file has been temporary
	commented out and has to be re-written so that to work with
	Bitmaps rather than Matrices. The function matrix_hsv_to_rgb is no
	longer used by Plot, but have been moved to testplot, in case we
	need it for testing purpose in the future.

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.13: New version of HSVMap. It is a
	copy of the code of the soon to be unused matrix_hsv_to_rgb()
	function.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.55: Simplified the function
	load_images() in PlotGroup: got rid of unused tests and
	clipping. Intermediary step before directly returning a bitmap
	from Plot.

2005-12-16  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.48: Cleaned up documentation and
	comments

	* topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.12, topo/tests/testcfsom.py
	1.8: Cleaned up documentation, and moved ImageSaver to
	topo/tests/testcfsom.py

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.5: Cleaned up documentation and
	added ALERTs

	* topo/plotting/palette.py 1.6: Cleaned up documentation, added
	ALERTs, including the plan for the future

	* topo/plotting/__init__.py 1.6: Removed Histogram for now

2005-12-16  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.51: Changed default density from
	10000 to 10.

2005-12-16  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.12: Added alerts and cleaned up
	documentation and interface

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.11, topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.7:
	Cleaned up imports

	* topo/tests/testpalette.py 1.2, topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.10,
	topo/plotting/palette.py 1.5: Moved mostly-unused BLACK_BACKGROUND
	and WHITE_BACKGROUND options to the only place they are used, in
	palette.py.  Removed unused MONITOR_BASED_PLOTS and
	PAPER_BASED_PLOTS.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.47: Cleaned up imports

	* doc/Future_Work/index_text.php 1.2: Added more to do

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.5: Removed Histogram class

	* topo/plotting/histogram.py 1.4, topo/tests/testhistogram.py 1.3:
	Removed for now; may reinstate later if it is implemented

2005-12-16  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testplot.py 1.12, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.46,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.54, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.7:
	New version of Plot that now works with subclasses HSVPlot,RGBPlot
	and ColormapPlot. It is the first version for this code: only
	HSVPlot is implemented, and there is still things to change
	(e.g. using the Bitmap class from Plot instead of the
	matrix_hsv_to_rgb). Corresponding changes have been made in
	plotgroup.py, testpattern.py and testplot.py.

2005-12-16  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.36,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testpropertiesframe.py 1.6,

	1.9, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py 1.11, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py
	1.6: Reorganization of ParametersFrame, PropertiesFrame, and
	TestPattern. This is an intermediate checkin.

2005-12-15  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Team_Members/index_text.php 1.2: Added Risto to Team Members

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.53: Partial cleanup of
	documentation and imports

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.9: Removed unused BWMap

	* CONVENTIONS 1.20: Added convention for lists of imports

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.8, topo/tests/testbitmap.py 1.5,
	topo/tests/testsheetview.py 1.5: Removed unused BWMap

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.45: Added and removed ALERTs

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.7: Removed unused class

2005-12-15  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.52, topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py
	1.7, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.21,
	topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.14: Simplified the situated
	button mechanisms. I realised I had wrote unnecessary code for
	implementing it, and then simplified the code of my last commit
	about that.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.51, topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py
	1.6, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.20,
	topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.13: Added the situated button in
	UnitWeightPanel and ProjectionPanel, from the super-class
	CFSheetPlotPanel.Made the necessary changes in UnitWeightPlotGroup
	and ProjectionPlotGroup.

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.5: Forgotten file from the last
	commit concerning the deletion of the template and plot_group_key
	default value in PlotGroup. I should have committed this file at
	the same time.

2005-12-15  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.53, topo/projections/basic.py
	1.2: Added a draft of a SharedWeightProjection, which runs without
	errors but doesn't yet do what one would expect.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.26: Cleaned up retina_edge_buffer
	calculation; still needs more work to make sure that it matches
	C++ LISSOM

2005-12-15  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.50: Just got rid of the default
	value for template and plot_group_key in the __init__ of
	PlotGroup. Modified testpattern accordingly.

2005-12-15  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.8: Commented out unused
	set_values() method.

	* topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.7: Removed unused get_value()
	method.

	* topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.6: Removed set_value()
	method. Only used inside this class to access a dictionary
	element.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.24, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py
	1.4: Removed non-functioning reset_to_defaults() method from
	ParametersFrame. Added HACKALERT about 'reset to defaults' in
	testpattern.py and parametersframe.py for future implementation.

2005-12-15  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.3: Fixed problem with ModelEditor
	stealing the Tkinter mainloop, which was causing the command
	prompt to stop working immediately, and all remaining windows to
	stop working if the Model Editor window was closed

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.52: Fixed typo

2005-12-15  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.23: No visible change. Cleaned
	up code in create_widgets().

2005-12-15  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.44, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.49,
	topo/tests/testplot.py 1.11: Changed the Plot.matrices attribute
	to be named Plot.rgb_matrices. Made the corresponding changes in
	testplot.py and plotgroup.py. Also, write a new version of
	__situate_plot() in Plot, that now return and works with a
	three-tuple.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.43, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.48,
	topo/tests/testplot.py 1.10: Made the Plot.matrices attribute
	beeing a three-tuple instead of a list. Made corresponding changes
	in PlotGroup and TestPlot.

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.6, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.42,
	topo/tests/testbitmap.py 1.4, topo/tests/testplot.py 1.9: Moved
	the function matrix_hsv_to_rgb() from bitmap.py to plot.py.Made
	the corresponding changes in testplot.py and bitmap.py.

2005-12-15  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.23: Added ModelEditor to simulation
	menu items.

2005-12-15  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.41: Cleaned up the code: got rid of
	attribute normalize and situated, they are now passed as a
	parameter only. Rename situated to situate.

2005-12-15  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.22: Removed menu separator that is
	no longer required.

2005-12-14  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.25: Added retina edge buffer

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.47: Added ALERT

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.40: Fixed typos

2005-12-14  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.22: Two separate changes
	(sorry). (1) class_parameters() returns a dict. (2) Holding the
	mouse over a Parameter's name brings up the Parameter's __doc__.

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.3, topo/base/topoobject.py 1.17:
	class_parameters() returns a dict.

	* topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py 1.10: Minor change - no visible
	changes.

	* topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py 1.9: Updated a comment that I forgot
	on the previous update.

	* topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py 1.8: Slider only updates after
	'return' is pressed in the tag box. This prevents the tag limits
	changing to really big values after accidental inclusion of
	e.g. an extra 0 while typing. More importantly, expressions for
	max,min,and val won't be evaluated until the user presses
	'return'. This stops evaluation of partial expressions, and is
	important because now expressions are evaluated in __main__,
	variables etc. are available.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.21: TaggedSlider no longer has
	need_to_refresh_sliders attribute.

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testpropertiesframe.py 1.5,
	topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py 1.7: TaggedSlider uses
	utils.eval_atof() to evaluate strings in __main__, rather than
	using string.atof(). Removed redundant attribute
	need_to_refresh_slider. Tidied code a little and added small bits
	of documentation. In anticipation of slider max and min values
	being set from e.g. evaluated functions (for example when the
	value is a function and the upper bound must be extended), max and
	min slider variables are reverted to strings.

2005-12-14  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.2: Fixed ALERT that was holding up
	the tests

2005-12-14  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.39: Cleaned up Plot. Made some
	sub-function return results rather than modifying Plot
	attributes. Got rid of now unused attribute. Changed
	_get_matrices_from_view_dict to __extract_view_dict_info. Made
	other sub-function private.

	* topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.9,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.19, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py
	1.12: Added a temporary add to re-initialize the plot_list of a
	PlotGroup from a panel. It was done before by the function plot()
	in Plot, but we need now to re-create a new plot_list anytime
	(i.e. because the code previously in Plot.plot() is now in
	Plot.__init__()). This has to implemented in a better way and is
	only a temporary solution.

2005-12-14  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.5: Text boxes update when
	'return' is pressed. (This message does not apply to
	TaggedSliders' text boxes.)

	* topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py 1.6: TaggedSlider only updates from
	textbox if 'return' is pressed or the box loses focus. Previously
	input was passed through to the simulator the second it was typed.

2005-12-14  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.20: Made connect() return the
	connection created

2005-12-14  alan_lindsay  <alan_lindsay@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/editorobjects.py 1.1, topo/tkgui/editortools.py 1.1,
	topo/tkgui/editorwindow.py 1.1: Initial CVS version

2005-12-14  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.38, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.46,
	topo/tests/testplot.py 1.8: Moved the code of plot() in
	__init__(): plot() no longer exists in Plot, and the matrices
	bitmap are now created when the Plot() object is created. I made
	the corresponding changes in PlotGroup and TestPlot.

	* topo/tests/testplotengine.py 1.13, topo/plotting/plotengine.py
	1.37: Got rid of the unuseful add_plot_group() in PlotEngine;
	instead it is simpler to directly access the plot_group_dict when
	adding a PlotGroup. Made the corresponding changes in
	testplotengine.

2005-12-14  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.35: Corrected code accidentally
	committed in revision 1.33.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.34: Subclasses of Parameter now define
	__slots__ as appropriate.

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.16: Moved classlist() and descendents
	from() utils.py to parameter.py because it's unlikely for any user
	not using Parameters to want them.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.33, topo/base/utils.py 1.49: Moved
	classlist() and descendents() from utils.py to parameter.py
	because it's unlikely for any user not using Parameters to want
	them.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.51, topo/base/utils.py 1.48:
	Moved hebbian() from utils.py to connectionfield.py, where it is
	used.

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.11: Removed unused import

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.15, topo/base/utils.py 1.47,
	topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.20, topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.2:
	Moved class_parameters() from utils.py to topoobject.py.

	* topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.23: Renamed inputparamspanel.py
	to testpattern.py

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.19, topo/tests/tkgui/__init__.py
	1.4, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.19, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py
	1.21: Renamed inputparamspanel.py to testpattern.py, and
	InputParamsPanel to TestPattern.

	* topo/tkgui/testpattern.py 1.1: Renamed inputparamspanel.py to
	testpattern.py

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.18, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py
	1.20: Removed auto-refresh menu item. Topoconsole's list of panels
	to refresh automatically is no longer accessed through functions.

2005-12-14  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.6: Changed
	DivisiveHebbian_Fallback to DivisiveHebbian_Py

	* topo/__init__.py 1.47: Removed nonexistent directory

2005-12-14  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.18, topo/base/connectionfield.py
	1.50, topo/base/sheet.py 1.33: - merged the slice tuple in
	ConnectionField into slice_array.

2005-12-14  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.5: Added wrapper classes for
	optimization Fallback to set the correct output_fn for GenericCFLF

2005-12-14  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.45, topo/tests/testplot.py 1.7,
	topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.22, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.37:
	Changed Plot class so that it takes a dictionary specifying the
	different channels, instead of a three-tuple. That way, it will be
	easier to extend the code for passing more information to a Plot
	object. This new change will also enable a better version of the
	current code of Plot. The call to Plot() has been modified
	accordingly in plotgroup.py, inputsparampanel.py and testplot.py.

2005-12-13  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/__init__.py 1.5, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.19:
	Changed the import of all patterngenerators to be in
	tkgui/__init__.py instead of tkgui/topoconsole.py

2005-12-13  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.18, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py
	1.15: Gave up on Tkinter Border mechanism, and I now draw a
	rectangle around the plot instead.

	* topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.17: Added CANVASBUFFER.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.14: Added CANVASBUFFER.  Fixed
	flicker that was introduced by adding borders.

2005-12-13  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.36: Switched from using MLab.clip() to
	using Numeric.clip().

2005-12-13  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.4: New version for current
	classes.

2005-12-13  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.35: Added a comment.

2005-12-13  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.13, topo/base/sheetview.py 1.7,
	topo/plotting/plot.py 1.34: Cleaned up imports, comments, alerts,
	and documentation

2005-12-13  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.17: When topoconsole loads a new
	Simulator, it needs to tell itself that the active_sim will have
	changed.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.50: Increasing y was moving the
	pattern downwards, an error introduced in revision 1.37.

2005-12-13  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.36: Cleaned up the doc.

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.4: Updated the plotgrouptemplate of
	UnitWeightPlotGroup and ProjectionPlotGroup according to the new
	changes in plotgroup.py and plot.py.

	* topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.11: Got rid of an old part of
	the code that is no longer used. Now, no information is passed by
	the UnitWeight template, all is done with the plot_group_key. The
	template should also be changed in template.py.

2005-12-13  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.17: Added ALERT

2005-12-13  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.44: Got rid of old comments.

2005-12-13  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.16, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py
	1.12: Added comment information about BORDERWIDTH and canvas
	offsets.

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.4: Added a Hebbian_Py to allow
	optimized fallback support for Hebbian

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.49: Added output_fn, since
	CFProjection needed it.

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.15: Added TopoObject import

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.14: Forgot to import optimized

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.13: Added fallback for optimized
	functions.

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.33, topo/projections/optimized.py 1.11,
	topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.3: Changed incorrect comment,
	expanded warning message.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.48: Removed unneeded import

2005-12-13  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.33: Added the possibility to get
	situated plot. The code is working, but is not in use for the
	moment (it would require to create Plot() with the option
	situated=True when creating a plot from the plotgroup class).

2005-12-12  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.32: Minor change in the code: the
	self.plot_bounding_box passed as a parameter is no longer use for
	passing the sheet bounding_box to submatrix(). Instead, this
	bounds comes from the bigger matrix in self.matrices in the case
	where slicing is required. This will enable to pass whatever
	plot_bounding_box for situating the plot if required. Added a
	comment and an alert about that, because I might not have thought
	of some special cases (though not yet implemented) where that
	would not work.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.31: Added comments and TO DO notes,
	updated the doc.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.30: Added a function _get_slice() as a
	subfunction of plot. It consists of the code that deals with
	slicing the different matrices to the size of the smallest view;
	it was previously in _make_hsv_matrix.

2005-12-12  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.32: - Replaced _NumberBoundsException
	with the buit-in ValueError.

2005-12-12  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.14: Updated load_snapshot() to reflect
	changes to active_sim().

2005-12-12  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.29: Minor cleaning of the code in
	_make_hsv_matrix.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.28: Cleaned up the code: now the empty
	plot exception is caught from plot() instead to be caught in the
	sub-function _make_hsv_matrices() (I think it is clearer); also
	minor correction to comments.

2005-12-12  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.24: Removed apparently outdated comment

2005-12-12  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.27: Minor correction of the code in the
	cropping case. Got rid of some old comments and added new one.

2005-12-12  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.21: Altered a hackalert.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.31: Added HACKALERT.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.45: Reverted accidentally committed
	change in previous version (where Rectangle's softbounds were
	removed.

	* topo/outputfns/__init__.py 1.3, topo/patterns/__init__.py 1.4,
	topo/patterns/basic.py 1.44, topo/patterns/image.py 1.20,
	topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.18, topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py
	1.21, topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.18:
	PatternGeneratorParameter and OutputFunctionParameter now exist in
	the __init__ file for their respective packages. They are
	subclasses of PackageParameter.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.30: Added PackageParameter(Parameter)
	to parameter.py. This is the base class for a Parameter such as an
	OutputFunctionParameter, which can be set to an OutputFunction and
	and return a list of available OutputFunctions.

2005-12-12  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/optimized.py 1.10: Corrected the call to
	CFProjection.change_bounds to only take two parameters. he
	optimized.change_bounds method also take two parameters now, as
	the output_fn is an attribute of CFProjection; that solves the
	problem that occured when running the optimized version of LISSOM.

2005-12-12  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.29, topo/patterns/basic.py 1.43,
	topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.20: Added PackageParameter to
	topo/base/parameter.py. This is the base class for Parameters such
	as PatternGeneratorParameter, which do things like return the list
	of all types of a class in a package.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.17,
	topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py 1.4: Continued cleaning. Added
	documentation. ParametersFrame doesn't convert Parameter values to
	strings - that was already being done by PropertiesFrame.
	PropertiesFrame defaults to a string_translator of
	topo.base.utils.eval_atof() instead of string.atof() so that any
	expression valid at the command line can be entered in the test
	patterns window (e.g. 'cos(pi/2)', if cos has been imported from
	math into __main__.__dict__ - that is, if 'from math import cos'
	has been done at the command line).

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testpropertiesframe.py 1.3: Number bounds stay
	as floats (rather than float->string->float).

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.46: Moved an import statement and added a
	HACKALERT about it.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.16, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py
	1.5: Number bounds stay as floats (rather than
	float->string->float).

2005-12-12  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.15, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py
	1.11: Added borders to Canvas images

2005-12-12  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.19,
	topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.15: ^D &

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.45: Removed HACKALERT from
	class_parameters()

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.28: Moved some documentation to
	circumvent hidden class docstrings; added HACKALERT about it.

2005-12-12  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/misc/inlinec.py 1.2: Updated comment

	* topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.2, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.32,
	topo/projections/optimized.py 1.9: Added Python-only fallback
	function definition.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.47: Restored GenericCFResponseFcn
	as default response_fn to restore topo.base requirement to not
	point to outside functions.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.23, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.10,
	examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.12, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.14: Remove
	default option for response_fn

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.46: Removed optimized switch in
	CFProjection.

2005-12-11  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/templates.py 1.3: Changed the Projection and
	UnitWeight PlotGroupTemplate so that it colors the plot with
	OrientationPreference (the Confidence key hasn't been added even
	though it works).

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.43: Minor correction.

2005-12-11  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py 1.7,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testplotgrouppanel.py 1.2,
	topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.6, topo/tests/testpatterngenerator.py
	1.2: PatternGenerators use aspect_ratio and size rather than
	height and width.

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.11: Uses size and aspect_ratio rather
	than height and width.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.22, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.9:
	Uses size and aspect_ratio rather than height and width. Since
	height and width of the GaussianGenerator are important parameters
	of the model (for matching other work), they are shown explicitly.

2005-12-11  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.26, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.42: New
	version of plot.py that support coloring the weights and
	projection by passing the 'Hue' and 'Confidence' plot keys define
	by the UnitWeight or the Projection plotgroup template. The code
	in plot.py is working but remains to be clarified and
	simplified. Changes in plotgroup.py are only related to the
	changes in plot.py.

2005-12-11  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.42, topo/patterns/image.py 1.19: Use
	size and aspect_ratio rather than height and width.

2005-12-11  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.45: Corrected an error that I
	made with CVS. Basically, I had got rid of the changes made by
	version 1.39 to 1.41 because checking a non-updated code. I
	re-added these changes and this version is correct.

2005-12-11  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.18: Uses same sheet2matrixidx() as is
	in topo.base.sheet, except this works for scalars and arrays.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.13: Added a comment and some
	commented-out code so my changes don't get left behind. No visible
	change.

2005-12-11  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.44: Replaced the code to build
	the bounds by a call to the new slice2bounds function in
	sheet. The same code is performed, but it has been moved in
	slice2bounds so that to have the two function slice2bounds and
	bounds2slice both in sheet.py.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.12: Added a test
	slice2bounds_bounds2slice that test the transformation from slice
	to bounds and bounds to slice using the bounds2slice and
	slice2bounds function.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.32: Added a function slice2bounds that
	returns the bounds corresponding to a given slice. This function
	is the e xact transformation of bounds2slice, i.e. when creating
	bounds with slice2bounds and convert tham back with bounds2slice,
	you are sure to have the same slice than at the begining.Also, I
	got rid of the former old version of bounds2slice that was
	commented out.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.43: Clarified the doc and change
	bounds_to_slice to its new name bounds2slice in a debug print.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.31: Got rid of the function
	input_slice(). It was previously used to generate the slice for a
	given ConnectionField, which is now done in the function
	__initialize_slice in ConnectionField. Also, changed the name of
	bounds_to_slice to be bounds2slice.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.42: Inserted the code that was
	previously in input_slice from sheet.py to the function
	__initialize_slice of connectionfield.py. input_slice is no longer
	used and will be deleted from sheet. Also, modified the bounding
	box for a weight so that to add a small margin around the bounds
	(i.e. for solving the problem of getting the right sloces from the
	bounding box afterwards).

2005-12-11  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/index_text.php 1.3: Added some notes for the
	manual

2005-12-11  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.30: New version of bounds_to_slice (the
	former one is still there but commented out). This function is not
	used for the moment, so changing it does not change the way
	topographica works. Also, I changed bounds2shape to an equivalent
	version, and updated the comment about that. Both solutions would
	be reasonnable, and give the appropriate results in the cases
	where we should use this function (i.E. in patterngenerator and
	for generating the weights); nevertheless, it is not possible to
	use this function for implementing the functions that need to
	transform a slice to bounds and then convert them back, that is
	why bounds2shape is no longer used by the bounds_to_slice
	function.

2005-12-11  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.29: Added some documentation about density
	to sheet2matrix().

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.11: Added test that sheet2matrixidx()
	is the inverse of matrixidx2sheet(). Renamed several functions.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.28: Removed a HACKALERT; rearranged some
	comments.

2005-12-11  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.27: Cleaned up comments and documentation

2005-12-11  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.41: - checked GenericCFLF() and
	uncommented the unchecked comment.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.21, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.8: -
	updated the comment to reflect the name change from
	DivisiveL1Normalize to DivisiveSumNormlaize

	* topo/eps/basic.py 1.3, topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.24,
	topo/learningfns/optimized.py 1.1, topo/projections/optimized.py
	1.8, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.20: - Added learningfns/optimized.py
	and move all the learning functions that need weave into it.

2005-12-11  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.10: Begun adding in full tests of
	Sheet defined by non-integer (right-left) and (top-bottom).

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.9: Added bounds2shape() test. Updated
	HACKALERT - the tests are not all being run for the awkward case.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.8: Continued cleaning tests.

2005-12-10  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.7: Continued adding tests for the
	functions in topo.base.sheet.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.6: Tidied up a bit and added some
	matrix2sheet() tests. matrixidx2sheet() tests haven't been
	reviewed yet.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.26: Removed some documentation I left in by
	accident.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.25: Changed sheet2matrixidx()

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.24: Added HACKALERT to sheet2matrixidx
	because I think it returns the wrong matrix row or column for some
	points outside the BoundingBox.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.5: Included sheet2matrix tests, and
	increased testing of sheet2matrixidx. Note that some of the new
	sheet2matrixidx tests fail. This is because I think
	sheet2matrixidx is incorrect for points just outside the left
	bound and points just outside the top bound.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.23: Corrected a mistake in my previous
	comment. No visible change.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.22: Added a comment about
	sheet2matrix(). Changed some documentation and a variable name to
	better describe its use. No visible change.

2005-12-10  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.10: Clarified alerts, and changed
	the name of Intersection to clarify that it works only for
	BoundingBoxes

2005-12-10  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.40: Changed GenericCF response_fn
	to CFDotProduct_Py.  GenericCFResponseFn() is the same as
	CFDotProduct_Py.  We want to call CFDotProduct_Py instead of
	GenericCFResponseFn, because the exact behavior of
	GenericCFResponseFn is controlled by the single_cf_fn parameter.

2005-12-10  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.23: - tested Hebbian() and
	uncommented it.

2005-12-10  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.10, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.13,
	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.19, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.7:
	Removed the CFDotProduct assignment since it's now the default for
	CFProjection

2005-12-09  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.39: Added inlinec.optimized
	switch for response_fn

2005-12-09  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.19, topo/tests/testsimulator.py 1.2: -
	Simulator.objects(baseclass) has the default argument
	baseclass=EventProcessor - Removed
	Simulator.get_event_processors(), which is essentially the same as
	Simulator.objects() now - Updated the tests accordingly.

2005-12-09  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.22: Commented out Hebbian, comment
	said it's untested, so may as well make explicit that it's not
	being used.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.18: Adjusted comment

2005-12-09  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.21: Re-wrote bounds2shape so that it uses
	sheet2matixidx. This has be done so that all methods that
	transform sheet information to matrix information do it in a
	consistent way.

2005-12-09  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.17: Tidied documentation a bit and
	changed some variable names. No visible change.

2005-12-09  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.14: Cleaned up imports and comments

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.27, topo/base/topoobject.py 1.13: Made
	__doc__ return the doc slot properly when called on a TopoObject,
	even for subclasses of Parameter, allowing us to remove a hack
	from TopoMetaclass

2005-12-09  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.20: Minor change in the doc. Deleted a line
	of code that were overwritten in bounds_to_slice.

2005-12-09  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/Makefile 1.3, examples/image_example.py 1.15,
	examples/test.ppm 1.2: Removed outdated image_example.py and
	associated image

2005-12-09  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.16, topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.14:
	Changed name of EnumeratedParameter to Enumeration.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.26: Changed the name of
	EnumeratedParameter to Enumeration. Updated Parameter
	documentation.

2005-12-09  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.19: Deleted a comment that I had wrongly
	added to the last commit.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.18: Changed the name of one of the two
	functions input_slice to be bounds_to_slice (I picked the one that
	is used by submatrix and only takes three parameters: real bounds,
	sheet bounds and density. This function, as well as submatrix, is
	not used for the moment). I also added two ALERTS concerning
	problem with the future version of plot.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.38: Now we pass the real bounds
	of the weight instead of the sheet bounds when creating a UnitView
	(in get_view() in CFProjection). Corrected the call to
	matrix2sheet for creating the bounds in ConnectionField (now the
	bounding box is really the boundaries of the weight
	submatrix). Added temporary debug print and deleted a
	JABHACKALERT.

2005-12-09  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.9: - removed the unnecssary import
	* from Numeric

2005-12-08  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.18,
	topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.13, topo/tkgui/propertiesframe.py
	1.3, topo/patterns/image.py 1.15,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testpropertiesframe.py 1.2: Using
	EnumeratedParameter to allow different types of size normalization
	for images (i.e. initial scaling of image). Adjusted things in the
	GUI to allow this. These changes are again intermediate - there
	will be more to come.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.25: Added EnumeratedParameter. It's not
	finished and not documented but is committed.

2005-12-08  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.37: Added real bounds for this
	ConnectionField

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.17: Fixed bogus matrix2sheet definition --
	was accepting mx, my instead of float_row, float_col (i.e., in the
	wrong order, though it didn't matter because the function was
	being called with the order swapped.

	* topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.4: Added ALERT about missing tests

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.36: Added a function
	__initialize_slice in ConnectionField, containing code shared
	between __init__ and change_bounds. Made it clearer that the
	ConnectionField weight_bounds parameter is actually only a
	weights_bounds_template, and that x and y are locations in the
	input sheet, not the sheet owning this ConnectionField.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.16: Clarified by changing name and
	arguments of activity_submatrix to reflect their generality.
	Removed unused activity_submatrix method of Sheet.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.35: Removed unused self.bounds
	and contains() of ConnectionField

2005-12-08  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.49, topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.5,
	topo/tests/testplot.py 1.6, topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py 1.5,
	topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.7, topo/tests/testsheetview.py 1.4:
	Removed ImageGenerator class from patterngenerator.py. It wasn't
	being used any more by Topographica (there is already one in

	it's in testsheetview.py.

	topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.17: Cleaned up comments

2005-12-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.24: Updated documentation about
	slots. Added HACKALERT about using slots in subclasses of
	Parameter.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.23: Removed HACKALERT.

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.18: Changed documentation about
	active_sim.

2005-12-07  louisem  <louisem@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.9, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.12,
	examples/lissom_or.ty 1.17, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.6:
	Changed confusing bit -- had been specifying weights bounding box
	as a parameter to the weights_generator, but this was ignored.
	Now uses the CFProjection.weights_bounds parameter, which has the
	desired effect.

2005-12-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/__init__.py 1.4, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.13,
	topo/base/simulator.py 1.17, topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py
	1.6, topo/base/registry.py 1.8, topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.26:
	topo.base.simulator stores a list of objects that have asked to be
	notified when the active_sim changes. These objects must have a
	notify_of_active_sim() method, and this will be called when the
	active_sim changes. The objects can do whatever they need to
	once they receive this call, including changing their
	simulator. This means there is no need to store the 'active gui'
	(topoconsole) in the registry. TopoConsole is also only associated
	with one PlotEngine, so it is clarified. Added some HACKALERTs
	about further changes that are required.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.12: Added hackalert about loading a
	script.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.11: Minor update to 'help' variable
	names. Added hackalert about help items.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.10: Removed refresh_title()
	method. The simulator name used to be printed in the
	titlebar. Ever since that was removed, the title of the window has
	stayed constant, so now it's set in the TopoConsole
	constructor. Also removed some stray comments I left behind a
	while ago.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.40: Removed unused import.

2005-12-07  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.20: Added comments

2005-12-07  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.19: - use
	neighborhood_kernel_generator as a callable object instead of a
	class.

2005-12-07  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.11: Parameters that are class
	attributes of a TopoObject class inherit from Parameters with the
	same name in super classes of that TopoObject class - now
	including when the class attribute is set to be a new
	Parameter. Updated the documentation.

2005-12-06  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.10: Some clarification of
	TopoMetaclass. No visible changes.

2005-12-06  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.8, topo/plotting/plotengine.py
	1.35, topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.6,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.11, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py
	1.8: Changed the name and the order of the parameter for
	get_plot_cmd. Made the required change in the panel classes
	(changed the call to get_plot_cmd).

2005-12-06  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.9: Added a comment (and some code
	temporarily in a comment).

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.8: Made a method that does the
	inheritance for a Parameter, given the list of base classes of the
	TopoObject that owns the Parameter.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.40: Precedence constants for scale is
	no longer required since Parameters can inherit from those in the
	owning TopoObject's superclasses.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.44: Added a note to myself.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.47: 'precedence' constants are
	no longer required since Parameters can inherit from those in the
	owning TopoObject's superclasses.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.22: A Parameter's slots all default to
	None so that the TopoMetaclass knows when to try inheriting from
	the superclasses of the TopoObject that owns the Parameter.

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.7: Code to allow Parameters inside a
	TopoObject to inherit from Parameters with the same name in super
	classes of the TopoObject (just on creation of the TopoObject, for
	the moment).

2005-12-06  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.6: Added documentation (some of it
	prospective) for metaclass members

2005-12-06  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.5: Added an alert and
	deleted an unnecessary line of code in do_plot_cmd().

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.25: Minor correction in the doc.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.34: Minor changes: erased old
	comments, corrected the doc.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.7: Minor re-organization of the
	file: moved a function around, corrected doc, added alerts.

2005-12-06  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.18: use PatternGenerator to compute
	a matrix of neighborhood value instead of calling a pattern_fn
	every we need such value.

2005-12-06  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.5: Added information about how to
	install to non-default locations.

	* setup.bat 1.9, external/win32/setup.py 1.20: Added a
	BASE_INSTALL_PATH to the setup for a non-default install path.

	* topographica_script.py 1.15: Updated comment

	* external/win32/setup.py 1.19: Added the -g option to the
	topographica.bat startup script.

2005-12-05  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topographica_script.py 1.14: importing inlinec causes the same
	system fault that not importing weave causes.  Do a test, so that
	Windows users do not have to change the code.

	* topographica_script.py 1.13: Added source comment about need to
	import inlinec.

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.4: Removed import weave ordering
	comment.  Changed the compiler='gcc' reference to directions on
	how to use MSVC instead if desired.

	* topographica_script.py 1.12: Added inlinec import to test for
	weave immediately.

2005-12-05  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.34, topo/base/sheet.py 1.15,
	topo/base/sheetview.py 1.6, topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.3,
	topo/tests/testsheetview.py 1.3: Got rid of the function
	sheet_view() in Sheet (sheet.py) and in CFSheet
	(connectionfield.py). Now, the sheet_view() is always created
	explicitly, as well by get_view in CFProjection (for a UnitWeight
	view), or by specific function such as measure_or_pref or
	measure_activity;(eventually, we might want to make this process
	more uniform by creating measure_weight() and measure_projection()
	functions). Then, we access the sheet_view by directly looking for
	it in a sheet_view_dict. Changes have been made accordingly in
	sheetview.py,testsheet.py and testsheetview.py.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.33, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.39, topo/tests/testplotengine.py 1.9,
	topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.16: Added a parameter simulator
	in the __init__ fucntion for PlotGroups. The simulator has to be
	passed when creating the PlotGroup (generally from the plotengine,
	but also from InputParamsPanel). It allows to get rid of the call
	to active_sim() in PlotGroup. Corrected the calls in
	plotengine.py, inputparamspanel and testplotengine.py.

2005-12-05  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.46: Added a bit of documentation
	to Parameters, and reformatted other documentation

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.21: Made __doc__ work a little more
	like it does for normal objects

2005-12-05  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.20: Passing doc='' to the __init__()
	methods of subclasses of Parameter isn't necessary.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.19: Removed a HACKALERT.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.25: Expanded a HACKALERT.

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.12: Removed CEBHACKALERT.

	* topo/commands/__init__.py 1.3: Added documentation about
	commands printing warnings and avoiding raising errors so that
	batch runs etc. aren't interrupted.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.38: Expanded an alert about looking
	up active_sim.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.24, topo/tests/testfeaturemap.py
	1.7: topo.base.simulator tests if there is an active_sim and
	prints a warning if not, so callers don't need to do that. No
	longer passing a Simulator back and forth between methods.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.23, topo/commands/basic.py 1.11:
	topo.base.simulator tests if there is an active_sim and prints a
	warning if not, so callers don't need to do that. No longer
	passing a Simulator to methods in topo/commands/basic.py as we
	intend not to have more than one at a time.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.22, topo/base/simulator.py 1.16,
	topo/commands/basic.py 1.10, topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py 1.8,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.37,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testtopoconsole.py 1.3, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py
	1.9: topo.base.simulator now contains the methods get_active_sim()
	and set_active_sim(). get_active_sim() will print a warning if
	there is no active_sim, meaning callers do not have to do the test
	themselves.

2005-12-05  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.17, topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.19:
	Cleaned up comments and docstrings.  Removed unused functions from
	CFSOM

	* doc/images/Topologo.xcf 1.2, doc/images/T-bg.png 1.2,
	doc/images/logo_jb.png 1.2: No longer used

	1.3, topo/tests/testplotengine.py 1.8,
	topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py 1.3: Added an abstract class SOMLF
	that contains learning_radius for SOMs in
	learning_fn/basic.py. The old HebbianSOM is renamed to
	HebbianSOMLF and is a subclass of SOMLF. other files are changed
	accordingly.

2005-12-05  yschoe  <yschoe@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/shared/config.php 1.5: Edited button color scheme.

	* doc/images/topo-banner7.png 1.5: Edited banner subtitle.

2005-12-05  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testplotengine.py 1.7: Started re-writing
	testplotengine according to the changes in the file. The test is
	not truly working yet and cannot be use for testing (it does not
	crash though, but is not relevant).

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.36: Added the possibility to pass a
	string as a sheet_filter (instead of the only possibilities being
	to pass None or a function).

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.32: Clarified the doc, added some
	alerts, get rid of unused import.

2005-12-04  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/__init__.py 1.2: Added testoutputfnsbasic to the list
	of the import statement in tests/__init__.py. Now the test is
	performed when running make all topo/tests.

	* topo/tests/testplot.py 1.5: Continued to write testplot.py. The
	tests for plot.py are complete, except for catching the exeption
	of an empty plot.

2005-12-04  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.39: Fixed indentation

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.8: Minor fix

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.43: Minor update to comment

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.15: Updated documentation and
	comments slightly, added some alerts, and removed some outdated
	ones.

2005-12-04  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.10: - used output function
	PiecewiseLinear for V1, V2, and V3 so that the activations
	satuates at 1.0.

2005-12-04  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/registry.py 1.7, topo/base/simulator.py 1.15,

	1.9, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.7, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py
	1.6, topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.21: Whenever a Simulator is
	created, topo.base.simulator.active_sim is set to be that
	Simulator. Rather than going through the registry, this is now the
	place to find the active simulator. Files in tkgui use
	topo.tkgui.topoconsole.active_sim() to access this variable. The
	change-over from the previous ways of finding active_sim is not
	complete yet.

2005-12-04  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.12: Trivial space change

2005-12-04  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testplot.py 1.4: Started to re-write testplot.py
	according to the changes made in plot.py. The test is no longer
	entirely disabled.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.24: Continued simplified plot.py:
	re-organized the code in _make_hsv_matrices(). Added some
	comments, got rid of unused import statement, clarified the doc.

2005-12-04  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.9, examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.4,
	topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.33: - examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty
	and examples/hierarchical.ty use HebbianSOM as the learning_fn,
	which wat not specified before.  - moved the declaration of
	output_fn() in GenericCFLF() to IndentityCFLF().

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.14: - Added a neighborhood_fn
	paramter (defaulted to gaussian) in HebbianSOM.

	* topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.17, topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.13: -
	copied CFSOM.winner_coord() into HebbianSOM so that the winner can
	be found within the learning function.  - radius in HebbianSOM is
	renamed to learning_radius and is now a parameter of HebbianSOM
	instead of an argument in __call__().  - used
	patternfns.gaussian() instead of a hard-coded exponential function
	to compute the neighbour radius.

2005-12-03  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.11, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py
	1.3: Changed a HACKALERT.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.45: Added HACKALERT about using
	constants for the precedences - it's pretty ugly.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.14: Made use of Parameter ordering
	constants defined in topo/patterns/basic.py.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.44, topo/patterns/basic.py 1.38:
	Changed Parameter ordering.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.43: The previous commit was a
	mistake - I forgot the save my changes.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.42, topo/patterns/basic.py 1.37:
	Made it easier to specify an ordering of PatternGenerator
	Parameters by defining constant values for precedences of standard
	and typical PatternGenerator Parameters.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.18: Added note about pickling in the
	Parameter class docstring.

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.10, topo/tkgui/taggedslider.py
	1.2: Altered some comments.

	* CONVENTIONS 1.18: Really minor edit. Added a missing word.

	* topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.14,
	topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.9: Continued reorganization.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.42: Updated class_parameters(). Removed
	exp() (it's in arrayutils.py). Should clip_in_place() be in
	arrayutils.py instead?

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.36: Removed an alert - it should have
	been in patterngenerator.py.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.41: Changed a local variable
	name for clarity. Changed some comments and removed JABHACKALERT
	about generation of x and y vectors.

	DivisiveL1Normalize to DivisiveSumNormalize - renamed
	DivisiveL2Normalize to DivisiveLengthNormalize - replaced error
	message with real exception in boundingregion.py - removed the
	useless __init__ in IdentityCFLF in connectionfield.py and Identit
	y in projection.py - Added some comments and answers to questions
	about __produce_sampling_vectorsin patterngenerator.py - Move the
	functions in utils.py that depends on Numeric into a new file
	calledarrayutils.py - updated the tests

2005-12-02  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.17: Added another hack alert.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.16: Added comment and made slight
	cleanup to space.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.39, topo/patterns/basic.py 1.35,
	topo/patterns/image.py 1.13: Made Parameter definitions make use
	of precedence to offer an order to e.g. the GUI. The precedence
	attribute in Parameter (revision 1.15) does not quite work yet...

	* topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.13,
	topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.8: Continued reorganization to
	make ParametersFrame general for TopoObjects. Some clarifications
	in the code. Also made Parameter widgets be added in order of
	Parameter precedence (well, reverse order).

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.40: Added function keys_sorted_by_value()
	to return the keys of a dictionary sorted by value. Added a
	comment about the function name 'dict_sort()', which I think
	should be changed.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.15: Added 'precedence' attribute to
	Parameters. Precedence can be used to specify an ordering for
	Parameters within a TopoObject, which could be useful e.g. to
	order them in the GUI.

2005-12-02  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.31, topo/learningfns/basic.py
	1.11, topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.15, topo/tests/testcfsom.py 1.2,
	topo/tests/testfeaturemap.py 1.3, topo/tests/testpatternpresent.py
	1.2, topo/tests/testplotfilesaver.py 1.2, examples/cfsom_or.ty
	1.7: fixed the ALERTS in cfsom.py.  Moved most part of
	CFSOM.learn() into a new method HebbianSOM() in
	learningfns.py. CFSOM.learn() calls HebbianSOM() for each
	projection. Examples and test cases are updated accordingly.

2005-12-01  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgrouptemplate.py 1.2: Minor change to doc and
	comment.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.31, topo/plotting/plotfilesaver.py
	1.6, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.34,
	topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.4,
	topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.4, topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py
	1.12, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.5,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.8, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.6,
	topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.5: Changed the attribute and
	parameter name plot_key to be plot_group_key in PlotGroup and all
	the sub-classes. Changed the call accordingly in the
	PlotGroupPanel classes and PlotsMenuEntry in topoconsole.py.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.23: Minor re-organization of the file,
	just moved the code for release_sheetviews to another place.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.22: Continued to simplified plot.py. I
	created one more sub-function called _make_hsv_matrices in order
	to cut plot() in more comprehensive part. I also simplified the
	code by deleting unused tests unused plot attribute (channel_views
	does not exist anymore as we only need to keep a list of matrices
	but not the sheet_views itself, therefore
	_get_channel_views_from_sheet_view() is now
	_get_matrices_from_sheet_view()). Added some doc and comments,
	deleted some old alerts.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.21: Corrected an error on the last
	commit.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.20, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.20,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.33, topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py
	1.11: Continued cleaning up plot.py. Added comments erased old
	ones. Reorganized the function
	_get_channel_views_from_view_dict(). I also made change to the way
	name are handled, and so made corresponding changes in
	featuremap.py, plotgroup.py and inputsparampanel.py; it is still
	not really good the way name are handled for the display and I
	left an Alert about it.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.19: Continued to clean up the
	file. Added some alerts and deleted some old ones, reviewed the
	doc and renamed and made private the function
	_get_channel_views_from_view_dict().

2005-12-01  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.12: Removed HACKALERT - filename can
	now be visible on inputparamspanel.

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.14: Uses os.path.normpath() to convert
	UNIX-style paths to the style of the user's operating system.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.11: Changed image filename's variable
	name to 'filename' - it's clearer.

	* topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.10,
	topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.7: Intermediate commit during
	reorganization. Filename Parameters now work (in that the image
	can be changed - the behaviour of the text box will be
	improved). There is more reorganization to come.

2005-11-30  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testplot.py 1.3, topo/tests/testplotengine.py 1.6,
	topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.5: Temporarily commented out some
	tests while re-organizing plot.py, plotgroup.py and
	plotengine.py. They will be re-written very soon.

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.14: Got rid of the function
	look_up_dict. The method get will be used instead when passing
	None as a second parameter that is returned if the key is not in
	the dictionnary.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.30, topo/tests/testplotengine.py
	1.5, topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.4, topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py
	1.5: Corrected the import statement for PlotTemplate and
	PlotGroupTemplate, now that they have been moved in
	plotgrouptemplate.py.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.18: Got rid of PlotTemplate that is now
	in plotgrouptemplate.py. Reviewed the doc and corrected the import
	statement.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.32: Got rid of PlotGroupTemplate
	and template definitions that are now in
	plotgrouptemplate.py. Reviewed the doc and corrected the import
	statement.

	* topo/plotting/plotgrouptemplate.py 1.1: Added a new file
	plotgrouptemplate.py that contains: the PlotTemplate class (that
	was previously in plot.py) and the PlotGroup class (previously in
	plotgroup.py), as well as the definitions of the PlotGroupTemplate
	objects and their recording in the registry (previously in
	plotgroup.py, too). This way, there is a relatively short and
	clean file for the user to add PlotGroupTemplate definition in,
	while benifiting at the same time from the doc and the code
	contain in the PlotTemplate and PlotGroupTemplate class.

2005-11-30  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.13, topo/patterns/image.py 1.10: Added
	a Parameter called Filename. This takes a string specifying the
	path to the file, but when asked for its value, returns the path
	in the correct format for the operating system. Or at least, it
	will but probably doesn't at the moment - see the HACKALERT.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.38: Removed unused import
	statements.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.37: Had been receiving the
	GeneratorSheet's x and y bounds switched around (because of 'x/y
	hack patch' in GeneratorSheet, so it was itself flipping x and y
	again. Now that GeneratorSheet passes the actual bounds, this
	doesn't flip x and y anymore. Also simplified the functions a bit.

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.8: Corrected LineGenerator's bounds.

2005-11-30  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/optimized.py 1.6, topo/learningfns/basic.py
	1.10, topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.10: Changed import of weave to
	import of inlinec wrapper.

	* topo/base/inlinec.py 1.5: Added named_parameters for inline to
	make remote reference calls easier to handle

	* topo/projections/optimized.py 1.5: Removed an import star

	* topo/base/inlinec.py 1.4: Added named value dictionary parameter
	to functions

2005-11-29  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.3: Clarified how constant was
	calculated

2005-11-29  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.19: Changed the
	sheet_view.view_info['src_name'] so that it displays nicely in the
	GUI.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.17, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.31,
	topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.9: Changed plot so that it takes
	a sheet view dictionnary as a calling parameter instead of a
	sheet. There is not the possibility anymore to pass directly a
	sheet_view to Plot() but only a sheet_view_dict and the three
	channels that are defined by the template (e.g
	(plot_key,None,None) for UnitWeight. plotgroup.py and
	inputparampanel have been changed accordingly.

2005-11-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.7: Made previous change less extreme
	- GeneratorSheets' BoundingBoxes are now centered on
	(0,0). Before, it might have looked like a bug to a new user.

2005-11-29  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.29: Very minor changes to comment.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.30: Continued clarifying
	plotgroup.py. Now, it creates the plot for a projection by calling
	plot with a plot_key, and no more list of UnitViews is stored in
	the sheet_view_dict. Instead, when creating the plots, a
	ProjectionPlotGroup will catch each unit view with the
	corresponding Weights plot_key.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.29: Continued to clean up and
	simplify the file. In particular, the create_plots function for
	the UnitWeightPlotGroup does get the location of the unit from the
	template anymore, but from the plot_key passed when creating the
	PlotGroup. Also, in the same function, made the call to Plot more
	general by adding the possibility to have a hue and confidence
	parameter (it still does not work though when adding
	'Hue'='OrientationPreference') to the UnitWeight template). Added
	comments and clarified others.

2005-11-29  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.14: Changed Parameters to Numbers for
	clarity; should also get at least lower bounds

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.6: Fixed typo

	* examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.2: Fixed density

	* examples/obermayer_pnas90.ty 1.1: Initial version based on
	cfsom_or.py

2005-11-29  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.16, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.28,
	topo/base/sheet.py 1.13: Fixed a little bug caused momentarily
	because I forgot to use look_up_dict when requested a sheet_view
	from the sheet_view_dict. Finally, I used
	sheet_view_dict.get(key,None), and I think we could get rid of
	look_up_dict. I added some comments about that. Also, modified
	some comments in plotgorup.py.

2005-11-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.16: Removed 'patterngenerator
	hack patch to get x/y right outside of kfs' because I think it was
	incorrectly swapping the x and y axes of GeneratorSheets.

2005-11-29  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.30, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.15:
	Got rid of an hack that were dealing with the list of UnitView
	that were added to the sheet_view_dict for a
	UnitViewPlotGroup. Now, a given UnitWeight plot_key correspond to
	a single UnitView in the sheet_view_dict. Some comments have been
	added in CFSheet in connectionfield.py for some more future
	changes.

2005-11-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.6: Now uses a rectangular retina: no
	more hiding from flipped x and y coordinates. (The box is also not
	centered about (0,0).) Updated the LineGenerator's BoundingBox -
	not sure if it's the right kind of size. Should LineGenerator.x's
	BoundingBox etc also be changed slightly?

2005-11-29  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.29: Changed unit_view in
	ConnectionField so that it inserts UnitView in the sheet_view_dict
	instead of one element list of UnitView. Also modified the doc of
	unit_view.

2005-11-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.15: Moved
	PatternGeneratorParameter from topo.base.patterngenerator to
	topo.patterns.base.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.39: classname_repr() doesn't default to
	chopping off the suffix 'Generator'.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.38: Added comment to
	find_classes_in_package().

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.36, topo/patterns/basic.py 1.34:
	Moved PatternGeneratorParameter from topo.base.patterngenerator to
	topo.patterns.base.

	* topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.4: Added statement to import all
	patterns, and a note to update the comment.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.35,
	topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.14, topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py
	1.6: Moved PatternGeneratorParameter from
	topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py to topo/base/patterngenerator.py

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.37: Added comment for myself.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.34: Added note to myself about
	reorganization of parametersframe.py

	* topo/base/registry.py 1.6, topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.13,
	topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.8, topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py
	1.5: The registry no longer holds a list of
	PatternGenerators. Instead, there is a class
	PatternGeneratorParameter that has a method to perform the same
	function. PatternGeneratorParameter is not finished, and is not in
	its final location.

2005-11-29  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/inlinec.py 1.3: Added optimized flag and made use
	exceptions

2005-11-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.12: Added comment about 'patch
	to get x/y right outside of kernelfactories': I think it should be
	removed.

2005-11-29  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.28, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.14,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.27: Re-organization of plot.py and
	corresponding changes in plotgroup.py. Mostly, plot has been
	simplified and unused part of the code have been erased. Now, to
	create a Plot you pass the sheet and three channels, that will be
	set for each PlotGroup as it is described in the template (it is
	planed that in the future, the sheet_view_dict will be passed
	instead of the sheet). There is still some issues for a
	ProjectionPlotGroup because of the way the sheet_view_dict is
	constructed in this case (accepting a list of sheet_views). There
	is also a similar problem for UnitViewPlotGroup that is fixed by
	an hack in plot.py; that has to be changed in unit_view in
	connectionfield.py. Finally, handling of the label display is now
	wrong, which leads to a double label in the activity panel. All
	this (relatively minor) problems should be fixed quickly, and have
	a corresponding JCALERT.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.18: Got rid of an unused debug
	print.

2005-11-28  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/inlinec.py 1.2: Changed the comments to not reference
	the dictionary.

	* topo/base/inlinec.py 1.1: Initial version.  Using this package
	inline function is the same as the Weave inline, except that it
	prints a failure warning if Weave was not able to be imported.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.36: Updated comment

2005-11-28  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.7: Changed a variable name to
	improve clarity.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.35, topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.6:
	Made a function classname_repr() out of part of the
	patterngenerator_names() function. classname_repr() is available
	in topo.base.utils.

2005-11-28  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.17, topo/base/sheet.py 1.12: Added
	the function measure_activity in featuremap.py; this function just
	load up the activity sheet view for all the Sheets in the
	simulator. t will eventually allow to get rid of the sheet_view
	function in sheet, instead directly working on the
	sheet_view_dict sheet attribute (I added an alert for that in
	sheet.py). It remains to add measure_activity() instead of pass in
	the command field of the activity PlotGroupTemplate; I have done
	it and it works, but I could not commit plotgroup.py since I am
	in the middle of some re-organization of the file that will take
	some more time.

2005-11-28  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.33: Changed note to myself.

	* topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.5,
	topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.4: Moved create_patterns() from
	ParameterFrame to InputParamsPanel since it's not in general
	useful to ParameterFrame objects.

2005-11-28  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.4: Fixed typo

2005-11-28  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.3: Changes to make the file
	easier to read (removed any unused attributes, made functions
	private if they aren't used outside the class).

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.9: Now uses sheet2matrixidx() from
	Sheet. This is an intermediate check-in because there is no
	automatic scaling.

2005-11-28  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.13: Added temporary comments and alert
	for future file re-organization.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.28: Added a minor alert.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.26, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py
	1.4, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.7: Added an alert about a
	PlotGroup.plots() being called for nothing in the PlotGroupPanels.

2005-11-28  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.8: Made edge_average() more like the
	C++ version.

2005-11-27  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.6: Cleaned up docstring

2005-11-27  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.27, topo/base/patterngenerator.py
	1.33, topo/base/sheet.py 1.11, topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.13,
	topo/sheets/composer.py 1.8, topo/tests/testsheet.py 1.2: Fixed
	the ALERTS on matrix2sheet and sheet2matrix.  Any transformation
	between matrix indices and sheet coordinates should now be done
	through matrixidx2sheet and sheet2matrixidx. The test cases are
	updated accodringly.

2005-11-26  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.25, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py
	1.5: Added the sheet name for the plot_key of a
	ProjectionPlotGroup, so that the connection can have the same name
	for two different sheets, and still the plot_key will
	differentiate them. That fixes a bug that was occuring with
	hierarchical.ty: when switching form V1 to V2 the AfferentLeft and
	AfferentRight were the same. It was because both
	ProjectionPlotGroup had the same plot_key, without the sheet
	differentiating them. Also modified some comments in plotgroup.py.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.24: Got rid of the
	initialize_plot_list function for ProjectionPlotGroup by adding
	some code in its create_plots function. Now, initialize_plot_list
	is only implemented in the superclass PlotGroup, and no sub-class
	have to re-implement it. Also, minor changes in the comments.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.27: Changed the default value of
	group_type to be None instead of 'BasicPlotGroup', because the
	case of a string was unused (it is always a template that should
	be passed) in the function get_plot_group; I also changed the
	comment about get_plot_group and the possible changes still to be
	done on it.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.26, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.23, topo/tests/testplotengine.py 1.4,
	topo/tests/testplotgroup.py 1.3: Continued clarifying PlotEngine
	and PlotGroup. I got rid of the function sheet_filter that wasn't
	really useful (in both plotengine and plotgroup), I got rid of the
	default values in the make_plot_group function of PlotEngine to
	avoid confusion, got rid of the corresponding JCALERT and modified
	some comments. I changed the testplotengine and tesplotgroup
	accordingly.

2005-11-26  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.3: Updated the formatting.

2005-11-26  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.22: Minor change to comment; also
	put the simulator to be an attribute of the super-class PlotGroup,
	becasue it was re-defined in every sub-classes anyway.

	* topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py 1.4: Changed the call to
	PlotGroup in InputParamPanel to match the changes that have been
	done in PlotGroup.

2005-11-25  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/User_Manual/index_text.php 1.2, doc/shared/util.php 1.14:
	Added note about missing user manual

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.3: Removed bogus option

	* doc/Downloads/.cvsignore 1.2: More to ignore

	* doc/Downloads/win32_text.php 1.2: Added road map

	* README.txt 1.12, WIN32_INSTALL.txt 1.12,
	doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.2, doc/Downloads/win32_text.php
	1.1: Moved ../WIN32_INSTALL.txt to Downloads/win32_text.php

	* doc/Downloads/index_text.php 1.1, doc/Downloads/text.php 1.5,
	doc/User_Manual/text.php 1.3, doc/Home/text.php 1.4,
	doc/Reference_Manual/text.php 1.4, doc/Team_Members/text.php 1.3,
	doc/Tutorial/text.php 1.12, doc/Forums/text.php 1.3,
	doc/Future_Work/text.php 1.8: Moved */text.php to */index_text.php

	* doc/Makefile 1.6, doc/shared/index.php 1.6: Make PHP generation
	work for any source file named *_text.php, generating *.html.  For
	this to work, had to rename */text.php to */index_text.php, so
	that index.html is just a special case of the general rule.

	* doc/Forums/index_text.php 1.1, doc/Future_Work/index_text.php

2005-11-25  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/parametersframe.py 1.2: Minor change to comment.

	* topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.3: Minor change in prevision
	of future changes in PlotEngine (i.e. I will get rid of most of
	the default parameter value in get_plot_group and also re-order
	them)

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.25, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py
	1.21: Re-arranged the organization of both PlotEngine and
	PlotGroup. Now, the PlotEngine only creates the PlotGroups when
	first requested, and stores it in a dictionnary for later reuse;
	all the plots generation is now done in each subclasses of
	PlotGroup, instead of being done in the PlotEngine (i.e. the
	attribute plot_list is now generated when the PlotGroup is created
	instead of being passed as a parameter when creating the PlotGroup
	from the PlotEngine). It makes the organization of the plotting
	directory clearer, and solves some former bugs or limitations
	(e.g. it is now possible to add whatever parameter in the
	PlotGroupTemplates, like Hue or Confidence in the UnitWeights
	PlotTemplate). Nevertheless, it is the first checked-in version,
	but a lot remains to be done for cleaning up the file and
	improving its clarity; a lot of JCALERT have been written for this
	purpose. Also, the next step is to re-write the plot.py file and
	then improve again plotgroup.py accordingly.

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.3: Minor changes to the comments
	(again).

	* topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py 1.2: Minor changes to the comments.

2005-11-24  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testpreferencemappanel.py 1.4: Got rid of the

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testplotpanel.py 1.5: Got rid of the
	plotpanel.py file that have been replaced by plotgrouppanel.

	* topo/tests/tkgui/__init__.py 1.2: Changed the __init__.py file
	in the topo/tests/tkgui/ directory to replace testplotpanel by
	testplotgrouppanel and testpreferencemappanel by
	testbasicplotgrouppanel.

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testbasicplotgrouppanel.py 1.1: Changed the
	name of testpreferencemappanel.py to be
	testbasicplotgrouppanel.py.

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testplotgrouppanel.py 1.1: Changed the name of
	testplotpanel.py to be testplotgrouppanel.py.

	* topo/tkgui/preferencemappanel.py 1.5: Got rid of the file
	preferencemappanel.py that have been replaced by
	basicplotgrouppanel.py.

	* topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py 1.7: Got rid of the file plotpanel.py
	that have been replaced by plotgrouppanel.py.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.24,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py 1.4,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testpreferencemappanel.py 1.3,
	topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.3: Changed references to the module
	preferencemappanel to be basicplotgrouppanel in any files that
	used it.

	* topo/tests/tkgui/testplotpanel.py 1.4,
	topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.2,
	topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.3, topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py
	1.3, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.4,
	topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.4: Changed references to the
	module plotpanel to be plotgrouppanel in any files that used it.

	* topo/tkgui/basicplotgrouppanel.py 1.1: Renamed
	preferencemappanel.py to be basicplotgrouppanel.py (because
	PreferenceMapPanel and BasicPlotPanel are now merged into
	BasicPlotGroupPanel).

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.23, topo/tkgui/plotgrouppanel.py
	1.1: Renamed plotpanel.py to be plotgrouppanel.py

2005-11-24  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py 1.6: Clarified comment

2005-11-23  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py 1.5: Minor change to the comments.

2005-11-23  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/ellen_arthur_square.pgm 1.2: Removed square version of
	Ellen Arthur.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.7: Updated to use new
	ellen_arthur.pgm. Added some comments.

2005-11-23  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/ellen_arthur.pgm 1.1: Added full-resolution non-square
	version

2005-11-23  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.6: Background value is now an edge
	average. Also changed range to xrange in the sampling for loop
	because xrange is slightly faster for looping.

2005-11-22  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.5: Changed to use normalization
	function from outputfns/basic.py, and made the normalization
	function be a Parameter. Removed unused import statement.

	* topo/tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py 1.5: Removed the duplicated
	docstring.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.34: Just added a reference about infinity
	and NaN in Python.

	* topo/tests/testfeaturemap.py 1.2: Initial docstring was
	duplicated.

	* topo/base/distribution.py 1.14: Added reminder that we planned
	to refine the definition of selectivity for non-cyclic
	distributions.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.4: Changed how parts of retina with no
	image get an activity (no change to behavior yet.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.3: Image no longer wraps when it's made
	smaller than the retina.

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.2: Image's methods are no longer used
	for resizing.

2005-11-22  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* WIN32_INSTALL.txt 1.11: Removed two steps for Weave integration,
	since they are now part of the CVS distribution.

	* topo/projections/optimized.py 1.4, topo/learningfns/basic.py
	1.9: Split multi-arg inline string into individual entries in
	list.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.33: Changed float('inf') reference to the
	inf variable.

2005-11-21  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.9: Changed bzero in inlines to
	memset

2005-11-21  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/image.py 1.1: Initial version. Added so that I can
	track changes - the file will probably by split up and/or moved.

	* examples/ellen_arthur_square.pgm 1.1: Added as a sample image to
	use as retinal input.

2005-11-21  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* WIN32_INSTALL.txt 1.10: Added painful process to get Weave to
	work with Topographica under Windows

2005-11-21  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.32: a little faster crop_in_place

2005-11-20  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.26, topo/base/utils.py 1.31: - a
	more efficient clip_in_place() - documentation of
	ConnectionField.change_bounds().

2005-11-16  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py 1.4: Error on the last commit;
	correction of this error in the test file for outputfnsbasic.

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.11, topo/tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py
	1.3: Fixed the JCALERT about DivisiveLpNormalize; all the
	function/procedure in the file /outputfns/basic.py are now
	working; the testoutpufns has been fixed too. Nevertheless, the
	return x statement have still to be removed and the calls to be
	changed in any files using these procedures (though it seems to
	work fine when creating no intermediate copy and yet keeping a
	return statement); also note that for the moment the test file
	test both cases: procedure and function calls.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.22,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testactivitypanel.py 1.3,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testpreferencemappanel.py 1.2,
	topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py 1.4, topo/tkgui/preferencemappanel.py 1.4,
	topo/tkgui/topoconsole.py 1.2: Merged PreferenceMapPanel and
	BasicPlotPanel in a unique class BasicPlotGroupPanel (currently
	still in the file preferencemap.py), and got rid of the associated
	JABHACKALERT; changed the name accordingly in any file that used
	them;it remains to change the name of the file
	preferencemappanel.py to basicplotgrouppanel.py (and also
	plotpanel.py to plotgrouppanel.py), also to write a function
	measure_activity() to pass to the Activity PlotGroupTemplate
	instead of pass for the moment; added a JCALERT for that in
	preferencemappanel.py.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.21,
	topo/tests/tkgui/testplotpanel.py 1.3,
	topo/tkgui/cfsheetplotpanel.py 1.2, topo/tkgui/inputparamspanel.py
	1.2, topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py 1.3, topo/tkgui/preferencemappanel.py
	1.3, topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.3,
	topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py 1.3: Changed the name of the
	PlotPanel class to be PlotGroupPanel, and got rid of a
	JABHACKALERT on this occasion. I added a JCALERT though, because I
	think we should change the name of the file plotpanel.py to
	plotgrouppanel.py, and also the name of the PlotGroupPanel
	sub-classes (e.g. BasicPlotPanel).

	* topo/tkgui/plotpanel.py 1.2: Got rid of an unused function
	(enum) and its associated JABALERT.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.20: Forgot to copy a comment.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.19: Continued to add comment for
	future re-organization of the file; re-wrote a part of the code
	and commented out the former one: now it is possible to add more
	things in Projection and Unit Weights PlotTemplate without being
	stopped at the PlotEngine level because the choice of plot is done
	according to the name of the PlotTemplates rather than what are
	their channels. The next step is to re-write plot.py so that to
	obtain colored plot in all the cases if we wish to.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.18: Added some JCALERT and comment
	for preparing the re-organization of the file; also commented out
	some part of the code that seems not to be used (It has been left
	in comment to help re-writing the file later).

2005-11-16  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.16: import CFProjection from
	topo.projections.basic instead of topo.base.connectionfield.

	* topo/projections/basic.py 1.1: added topo.projection.basic so
	that CFProjection can be imported from topo.projections.

2005-11-16  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.32: Removed another unused import
	statement.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.31: Removed unused import
	statement. Folded functions within SquareGratingGenerator and
	SineGratingGenerator. Corrected error that was having no effect: I
	don't understand why params.get() statements are present (so I
	added a note about that).

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.30: Missed an update on the last
	commit. For a SquareGrating to have horizontal bars at
	orientation=0, the sin() function must depend on the y coordinate
	rather than the x coordinate (see previous log message).

2005-11-15  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.32: Sorted out import
	statements.

2005-11-15  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* WIN32_INSTALL.txt 1.9: Added directions to the lissom_or.ty file
	for cutting Weave out of the Windows port.

2005-11-15  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.17: Started to clean up
	plotengine.py in the perspective of simplifying it a lot in the
	future: added comments to help, added JCALERT.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.16: Got rid of an irrelevant
	CEBALERT.

2005-11-15  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.31: Made setup_xy be a private
	method of PatternGenerator.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.30: Made transform_coordinates()
	be a private function of PatternGenerator.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.29: Made
	produce_pattern_matrices() be a private function of
	PatternGenerator.

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.28: Removed an item under a
	JABHACKALERT. Functions from sheet.py are already used.

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.5: Made the default Gaussian more like
	lissom_or.ty's by having it wider than it is high.

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.24: Changed gabor() also to vary
	sinusoidally with the y coordinate (see previous log message).

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.23, topo/base/patterngenerator.py
	1.27, topo/patterns/basic.py 1.29: The previous commit of
	patterngenerator.py caused the x and y values to be swapped: it
	turns out the rotations were not so mysterious! However, I think
	the x matrix was being setup incorrectly; it should have been
	rotated in the opposite sense. Now that the matrices are setup
	correctly, it makes sense to refer correctly to x and y in the
	various functions that use the x and y matrices. For example, for
	a SineGrating to have horizontal bars at orientation=0, the sin()
	function must depend on the y coordinate rather than the x
	coordinate.

2005-11-15  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/tests/testoutputfnsbasic.py 1.2: Corrected the test file
	for the outputfns so that it test both the procedure and the
	function call; also added some comments to clarify the situation.

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.10: Got rid of the clip_in_place
	function that have been put in utils.py; got rid of the JABALERT!
	about the x.savespace(1); added some JCALERT about the fact that
	we kept the return statement for the moment and also about
	DivisiveLpNormalize that could not have been made to work as a
	procedure.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.30: Moved the function clip_in_place from
	outputfns/basic.py to utils.py; also add some comment about the
	fact that I did not find any convenient matrix function to use for
	replacing the for loop

	* topo/tkgui/preferencemappanel.py 1.2,
	topo/tkgui/projectionpanel.py 1.2, topo/tkgui/unitweightspanel.py
	1.2: Got rid of the unused call to get_event_processor in the
	subclasses of PlotPanel; this function is almost not used anywhere
	now, and we might be able to get rid of it.

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.16: Got rid of unused lines in
	plotengine.py

2005-11-15  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.22, topo/base/patterngenerator.py
	1.26, topo/patterns/basic.py 1.28: Removed a mysterious 90-degree
	rotation from patterngenerator. Patterns now seem to be drawn at
	the conventional orientation. Updated line(), which had been
	changed to be horizontal for the tutorial. 'height' and 'width'
	are still probably confusing labels.

2005-11-15  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Downloads/text.php 1.4: Broke long line to fix formatting.
	Added instructions on updating.

	* README.txt 1.11: Added note

2005-11-14  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.15: updated instructions on running a
	pure python implementation.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.14: corrected the description on how to
	use the _CPointer classes.

2005-11-14  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	with date line.

	* external/win32/setup.py 1.18: Added more comments to FixedPoint
	section

	* WIN32_INSTALL.txt 1.7: Removed references to Dislin.  Added
	references to MatPlotLib and FixedPoint

	* external/win32/setup.py 1.17: Install FixedPoint package.

	* external/win32/.cvsignore 1.2: Added fixedpoint files

	* external/.cvsignore 1.12: Added Pmw.tar

	* external/win32/fixedpoint-0.1.2_patched.tgz 1.5: Typo in
	directory.  Added wait and B flag to setup.bat

	* external/win32/fixedpoint-0.1.2_patched.tgz 1.4: Changed bat
	startup directory to avoid infinite loop of calling setu.py

	* external/win32/fixedpoint-0.1.2_patched.tgz 1.3: Added a
	setup.bat file to allow changing directories for the setup.py file

	* external/win32/fixedpoint-0.1.2_patched.tgz 1.2: Changed
	permissions of setup file so it would run.  Changed name of setup
	file to setup.py

	* external/win32/fixedpoint-0.1.2_patched.tgz 1.1: Same as in the
	external dir, but already patched to make the Windows install
	easier.

2005-11-11  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.31: Removed unneeded imports

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.25, topo/plotting/plotengine.py

2005-11-11  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.13: changed the instruction on how to
	run the _CPointer classes.

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.24, topo/projections/optimized.py
	1.3: - change response_fn and learning_fn of CFProjection_CPointer
	into Parameter.  - remove the storing of normlaize_fn in
	ConnectionField. The function to normalize the weights are passed
	into __init__ and change_bound instead.

2005-11-10  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.14: Fixed error with UnitView
	plotting, sheet_view.  Was requesting sheet_view of the src
	instead of the target.  Also removed commented and deprecated
	code.  Warning still left in.

2005-11-10  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.12: Simplified switching between
	CPointer and non- versions

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.23: Fixed typo in warning

2005-11-10  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* external/win32/util/patch.exe 1.1: For fixedpoint patch file.

	* external/win32/README.txt 1.3: Removed dislin reference, added
	comment about MatPlotLib.

	* external/win32/setup.py 1.16: Removed dislin

	* external/win32/dl_83_py.tar.gz 1.2: Now using MatPlotLib
	instead.

2005-11-10  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/__init__.py 1.5: Upated __all__ list

2005-11-09  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.11: Added instructions for using
	Python-only code.

2005-11-09  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.30, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.10,
	topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.22, topo/base/patterngenerator.py
	1.25, topo/projections/optimized.py 1.2: learning_fn is now a
	parameter of CFProjection, instead of a Sheet.

2005-11-09  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Forums/text.php 1.2: Added bug and feature trackers

	* doc/images/051107_topographica_screen_shot_white.png 1.1:
	Initial version

	* doc/shared/index.php 1.5: New news

	* doc/Home/text.php 1.3: Minor cleanup

2005-11-09  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorial/images/activity_line.png 1.2,
	doc/Tutorial/images/activity_line_or.png 1.2,
	doc/Tutorial/images/test_pattern.png 1.4, doc/Tutorial/text.php
	1.9: Updated images to use line with a thickness that stops the
	retina appearing monochrome.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.27: Changed default thickness and
	smoothing of LineGenerator, and added a default scale
	parameter. This allows users of the tutorial to see reasonable
	responses without having to adjust the scale themselves.

2005-11-08  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorial/images/activity_line.png 1.1,
	doc/Tutorial/images/activity_line_or.png 1.1: Added line plot
	images, which I forgot on the last update.

2005-11-08  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile 1.28, doc/Downloads/text.php 1.2: Added tests and
	examples to 'all' target; it's what I'm always doing...

2005-11-08  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tutorial/text.php 1.8: Fixed mistake introduced by
	JAB. You'd think after all these years around LISSOM that he'd
	understand it.

	* doc/Tutorial/images/or_map.png 1.4,
	doc/Tutorial/images/projection.png 1.4,
	doc/Tutorial/images/test_pattern.png 1.3,
	doc/Tutorial/images/unit_weights_0_0.png 1.5,
	doc/Tutorial/text.php 1.7: Updated tutorial with screenshots from
	the new saved network (v.1.3), and using a line as the
	demonstration pattern.

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.3: Resaved the network so that
	first activity pattern viewed by a user is not some crazy-ass
	wiggly line. (I was messing with the input patterns before I saved
	the network.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.26: Adjusted default properties of
	LineGenerator() to give a reasonable response on lissom_or.ty.

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.21: Changed variable name x to y in
	line() as it better describes the idea.

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.2: New pickled network that was
	trained to 20000 with corrected LateralExcitatory bounds (see log
	message for examples/lissom.ty v.1.9).

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.9: Changed BoundingBox dimensions for
	final LateralExcitatory change of bounds at 2000
	iterations. Previously it was trying to enlarge the bounds for a
	48x48 V1.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.25: Corrected LineGenerator so that an
	orientation of zero is horizontal.

2005-11-08  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/__init__.py 1.44: Made warning less severe

	* doc/Tutorial/images/unit_weights_0_0.png 1.4,
	doc/Tutorial/text.php 1.6: Minor edits -- first complete version!

2005-11-08  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.20: Added a function sort_plots()
	that sort a list of plots according to their src_name (in
	plot.view_info['src_name']); it is then applied in the plots()
	method of PlotGroup to sort the bitmap list in alphabetical order;
	the function plots() is overwritten in the ProjectionPlotGroup
	so that it does not sort in this case (because it would otherwise
	sort the UnitView constituting the projection plot)

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.12: Erased an unused comment

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.13: Minor change in comment

	* topo/tests/testplotengine.py 1.3: Changed the test for
	plotengine so that it does not call the function _sheet anymore
	(because it has been erased)

	doc/Tutorial/text.php 1.5: Updated tutorial screenshots and
	recorded time to measure an OR map as about 30 sec.

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.8: Added hack to restore random
	properties of gaussian generators to make cfsom_or and lissom_or
	work after unpickling.

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.5: Now when being pickled, TopoObjects
	save their class attributes. Currently this only gets attributes
	from the object's class, not from any superclasses (see
	hackalert). There is a problem with this implementation: e.g. in
	the lissom_or.ty example, the random x,y,orientation parameters
	are not pickled correctly.

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.8: Changed BaseN to 48.0.

	* examples/lissom_or_20000.typ 1.1: Saved network for lissom_or.ty
	with a 48x48 V1

2005-11-06  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile 1.23: Added dependency to force re-make of
	documentation after a clean

	* doc/Makefile 1.2: Changed to remove pydoc-generated
	documentation only, since that can always be regenerated.  Kept
	PHP documentation around by default, since not everyone will have
	PHP, and it will rarely need updating anyway

	* doc/Reference_Manual/.cvsignore 1.2: More to ignore

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.27: Trivial fix to whitespace

	* topo/__init__.py 1.41: Updated with new directories

	* .cvsignore 1.5, Makefile 1.22, topo/base/gendocs.py 1.4: Move

2005-11-05  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.12: Changed the default parameters
	so that all match those of the equivalent LISSOM's measure_or_pref
	command.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.11: measure_or_pref() now takes a
	list of frequencies. The default is the list [2.4].

2005-11-05  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.2, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.3,
	examples/image_example.py 1.13, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.4,
	topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.10: Cleaned up comments

2005-11-05  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.3, topo/base/patternfns.py 1.19:
	patternfns.py is back to using the conventional definition of a
	Gaussian. lissom_or.ty adjusted so that it continues to match
	LISSOM, which does not use the same definition (doesn't use the
	factor of 0.5 in the exp's argument.

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.9: Changed use of deprecated uses
	of String.capitalize() to string_itself.capitalize(). Added
	HACKALERT about names of maps and what the GUI does with them.

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.4: Moved save_snapshot() and
	load_snapshot() to topo.commands.basic. topoconsole now asks for
	the filenames, and uses an extension .typ for saved networks. That
	obviously stands for 'topographica pickled network'. save_ and
	load_snapshot() in topo.commands.basic do nothing to the
	filenames. Maybe topoconsole shouldn't either? Currently, whatever
	the user types in the filename box will have .typ added to it.

2005-11-05  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/hierarchical.ty 1.2: Added extra areas and connections
	as examples of a hierarchy

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.22: Fixed bug in normalizing
	images

	* examples/Makefile 1.2: Updated filenames to match recent changes

2005-11-05  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/bitmap.py 1.3, topo/plotting/plot.py 1.9: change
	max(max(array)) to max(array.flat). max(array), where array is a
	2D matrix is ill-defined and gives unexpected resulted sometimes.

2005-11-04  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.26: fixed the counting of tsettle when
	learning is turned off.

2005-11-04  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom_or.ty 1.2: Changed to match changes in
	lissom/samples/or_map_topo.param

	* examples/cfsom-or.ty 1.2, examples/lissom-or.ty 1.2: Moved
	cfsom_example.py to cfsom_or.ty and lissom.ty to lissom_or.ty

	* examples/cfsom_or.ty 1.1, examples/lissom_or.ty 1.1: Slight name
	change

2005-11-04  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/gui_example.py 1.38, examples/hierarchical.ty 1.1:
	Changed the name of gui_example.py to be hierarchical.ty; also
	changed the way the gui example connected V1, V2 and the Retinas
	to something more realistic.

	* examples/cfsom-or.ty 1.1, examples/cfsom_example.py 1.28:
	Changed the name of cfsom_example.py to be cfsom-or.ty

	* examples/lissom-or.ty 1.1, examples/lissom.ty 1.58: Changed the
	name of lissom.ty to be lissom-or.ty

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.8: Added an hack so that a plot display
	the name from the PlotTemplate instead of the name of the
	SheetView; it would need more restructuring work to make sure this
	does not raise problems in the future.

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.16: Added space in the
	PlotTemplate's name so that the display is nice when using them in
	the GUI.

2005-11-04  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.13: Fixed apparent serious bug:
	SimulatorEvents were storing a reference to the data, not the
	actual data, which means that the data they provide when the event
	is delivered might be stale (or the opposite of stale? too
	fresh?).  Now that the data is deepcopy-ed, can remove the
	__copy__ routine, which is good, because it was skipping copying
	of the fn field, which could have been causing some recent
	problems involving switching back and forth between
	pattern_present and s.run()

	* examples/lissom.ty 1.57: Minor cleanup

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.20, topo/learningfns/basic.py
	1.7, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.25: Changed argument order for
	CFResponseFunctions and CFLearningFunctions

	* topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.11: Minor cleanup

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.19, topo/base/utils.py 1.26,
	topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.6, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.24: Renamed
	arguments to CFLearningFunctions

	* external/Imaging-1.1.4jp.tgz 1.10: Removed outdated library

	* external/dislin-8.2.linux.tgz 1.2, external/Makefile 1.27,
	external/.cvsignore 1.11, topo/plotting/dislindriver.py 1.3,
	topo/plotting/dislinplot.py 1.2: Removed DISLIN, at least for now,
	since we aren't using it

2005-11-04  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.5,
	topo/projections/kernelprojection.py 1.24,
	topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.6, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.23,
	topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.18, topo/base/projection.py 1.35:
	reduced the complexity in the argument list of CFResponseFunction
	and CFLearningFunction.

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.22: Changed input_event() so that it
	does not depend on the name of the projection to detect a new
	iteration.

2005-11-03  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.8: Reorganized to allow duration
	to be specified

2005-11-03  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.18: Reverted definition of gaussian to
	match LISSOM (factor of 0.5 in the exponential).

2005-11-03  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.8: Commented out unused function;
	add commentary for helping future cleaning up of the file.

2005-11-03  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.34, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.21: Moved
	projections() from LISSOM to ProjectionSheet.

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.17: Corrected two syntax mistakes
	introduced by accident. Added hackalert about use of the word
	'ellipse'

	* examples/lissom.ty 1.56, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.20: Updated
	lissom.ty to use LISSOM.projections() method to access projections
	(for changing projection learning rates and bounds), rather than
	LISSOM.change_learning_rate() and .change_bounds(). Removed
	change_learning_rate() and change_bounds() from
	LISSOM. LISSOM.projections() will be moved to projections.py.

2005-11-03  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.17: Removed illegal use of
	topo.learningfns

2005-11-03  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom.ty 1.55: Removed stray line I left by mistake.

	* examples/lissom.ty 1.54: Added hackalert detailing changes to
	make. I didn't make them because I know this file is currently
	being edited and the changes will clash.

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.19: Created a function projections()
	that returns a dictionary {projection.name: projection}. Removed
	lateral_projections() and afferent_projections(). Added hackalert
	to indicate that change_learning_rate() and change_bounds() should
	be removed when lissom.ty is updated.

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.16: Made __elipse() be a public
	function; updated other functions accordingly and changed some
	ring() and disk() internal variable names.

2005-11-03  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.18: Added alert and removed apparently
	redundant code

2005-11-03  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.16, topo/base/projection.py 1.33,
	topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.17: - Changed pre_sleep() in lissom.py
	such that the last iteration is a pure learning phase without
	computing the new activity.  - pre_sleep() in lissom.py now calls
	activate(), which is a method in the superclass ProjectionSheet.
	- learn() moved into CFSheet.

2005-11-03  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* Makefile 1.21: Made docs depend on all Python files

2005-11-02  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.8: Added alerts and cleaned up
	documentation.  Changed clip to clip_in_place

2005-11-02  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.25: Removed MakeStaticFunction.  Found the
	@staticmethod operator

2005-11-02  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.15: Forgot to save all my changes last
	time.

2005-11-02  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.7: Transformed the output functions so
	that they don't create intermediate copies of the array; rewrote a
	clip function for this purpose; left the return statement so that
	I did not have to change all the call to output functions in the
	rest of the code. Modified the test file so that it calls
	procedures instead of function.

2005-11-02  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.21: Removed comment after
	renaming user-visible variables.

	* examples/gui_example.py 1.37: Changed LineGenerator's 'width'
	parameter to 'thickness'.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.22: Changed disk() and ring() to be
	elliptical, so changed the parameters of DiskGenerator and
	RingGenerator to match (e.g. they have orientation now, radius has
	been replaced with height and width... Changed LineGenerator's
	'width' parameter to 'thickness' (sorry this is in the same
	commit).

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.14: Changed disk() and ring() to be
	elliptical.

2005-11-02  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.12: Removed the call to start() in the
	run() method: an EventProcessor is now start()ed when it is
	add()ed to the simulator. Merged _continue() into run() since
	run() only called continue after no longer starting the
	EventProcessors.

2005-11-02  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom.ty 1.53: Restored training of one iteration, due
	to strange bug with the event queue that's being addressed
	separately

	* topo/projections/kernelprojection.py 1.23: Removed strange
	Constant response_fns

2005-11-02  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.15: Activity is now colored by
	OrientationPreference, if it has been measured. This is ok while
	we're only talking about orientation maps.

2005-11-02  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.16: Added ALERTs

2005-11-02  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.24: Added a wrapper that allows Static
	class functions.

2005-11-02  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom.ty 1.52, topo/projections/kernelprojection.py
	1.22, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.15: LISSOM does not use the pointer
	implementation and so does lissom.ty.  A new subclass,
	LISSOMPointer, is added which uses the pointer implementation.

2005-11-01  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.7: Modified the measure_or_pref
	function so that we can pass some parameter such as: scale,
	offset, freq of the SineGrating used for measuring the map;
	user_function which by default is '_sinegrating_present' (but
	gives the possibility to also write _gaussian_present and change
	it when calling measure_or_pref); display which enables to see the
	patterns presented during the map measurement (display=True, False
	by default); apply_output_fn that enables to disable the output
	function (True by default). All this parameters can now be set
	from the command line in the Orientation Preference panel.

2005-11-01  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/projection.py 1.32, topo/commands/basic.py 1.3,
	topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.14: Added apply_output_fn option to
	ProjectionSheet, for use with e.g. pattern_present and
	measure_or_pref

2005-11-01  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/gendocs.py 1.3: Made more powerful so that source code
	can be in subdirectories.

	* Makefile 1.20: Updated to use new gendocs.py revision that
	handles directories in source code.

2005-10-31  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.14: Added a command parameter to
	the PlotGroupTemplates; this is the default command to execute
	when opening or refreshing the panel corresponding to this
	template

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.6: Added some debugging lines that
	enable to display the pattern that have been presented when
	measuring the map; they are currently commented out

2005-10-30  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.13: Simplified functions involving
	exp() after switching to Numeric-24.0. The functions should be as
	robust as they were in the previous version but the code is much
	clearer.

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.23: Clarified documentation string in
	exp().

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.22: Added an alternative to Numeric's exp()
	function; this one still uses Numeric's, but works for any
	magnitude of argument.

	* external/.cvsignore 1.10, external/Makefile 1.25,
	external/Numeric-23.0.tgz 1.2, external/Numeric-24.0.tar.gz 1.1:
	Substituted Numeric-23.0.tgz with
	Numeric-24.0.tar.gz. Numeric-24.0 handles nans and infs properly
	in arrays (rather than raising errors).

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.21: Changed 'fringe' to 'smoothing'

2005-10-30  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/kernelprojection.py 1.21,
	topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.5, topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.13,
	topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.15, topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.4:
	minor performance enhancement in CFDotProductP. Learning function
	DivisiveHebbianP uses pointers to get the weight array instead of
	using C API.

2005-10-30  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.20: Renamed gaussian_width to fringe (I
	bet it gets changed before you even read this). Changed names of
	parameters for ring to try to make it match disk more
	obviously. Altered some default parameter values.

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.12: Main change is to make all
	functions involving exp() behave more as would be expected by a
	user, although the changes do not affect current use of patternfns
	(e.g. as used by various PatternGenerators); these changes are
	hacks. Corrected mistake in previous commit made line() have same
	hack as ring() and disk(). Redefined gaussian fall-off to be
	exp(-0.5*(x/sigma)^2) rather than exp(-(x/sigma)^2) (can easily be
	reverted - the change was made for comparison). Slightly altered
	ring() to try to make it match disk() more obviously.

2005-10-29  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.21: Added comment about how inf is created
	in here as 1/0 rather than e.g. float('inf').

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.11: Fixed bug in Disk and Ring where
	there could be an attempt to work with 0*inf. The fix is a hack,
	though. This file might be better for using e.g. SciPy.

	* topo/patterns/basic.py 1.19: Renamed FuzzyRing to Ring and
	fuzzy_ring to ring; updated comments for Disk to reflect earlier
	change from FuzzyDisk

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.10: Renamed FuzzyRing to Ring and
	fuzzy_ring to ring

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.9, topo/patterns/basic.py 1.18:
	Renamed FuzzyDisk to Disk and fuzzy_disk() to disk().

	* examples/gui_example.py 1.36, topo/base/patternfns.py 1.8,
	topo/patterns/basic.py 1.17: Changed name of FuzzyLine to Line;
	fuzzy_line() changed to line()

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.13: Renamed user-visible instances
	of the variable 'theta' to 'orientation'

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.5: Now at least one frequency,
	phase, and orientation must be specified for measuring the map
	(instead of 'not zero' of them).

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.4, topo/base/patterngenerator.py
	1.20, topo/patterns/basic.py 1.16, topo/patterns/random.py 1.12,
	examples/cfsom_example.py 1.27, examples/gui_example.py 1.35,
	examples/lissom.ty 1.51: Renamed user-visible instances of the
	variable 'theta' to 'orientation'

2005-10-29  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* CONVENTIONS 1.17: Minor clarification

	* topo/base/sheet.py 1.10: Clarified previous ALERT

	* README.txt 1.7: Clarified what is not yet done

	* MILESTONES 1.10: Updated to reflect recent progress

2005-10-27  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.3: Get rid of an unused commentary

2005-10-27  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.7, topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.19,
	topo/patterns/basic.py 1.15: Made theta be a hidden parameter for
	fuzzy disk and ring since they are currently symmetric; removed
	variable y from fuzzyline() since it's not used; added comment
	about problem with fuzzyline.

2005-10-27  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.2: Added a raise error when trying
	to use 0 feature value in measure_or_pref; added some debugging
	statement in an attempt to display the pattern presented when
	measuring the map

2005-10-27  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.18: Removed comment about
	scale-0 error; the problem wasn't here.

2005-10-27  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/utils.py 1.20: Changed the norm function so that it
	works with the abs of the elements; necessary in the case of the
	Lp norm

2005-10-27  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.6: Temporary fix to avoid 0/0
	error. Numeric.where(test,pass_expression,fail_expression)
	calculates both pass_expression and fail_expression no matter what
	the result of test. test cannot therefore be used, for instance,
	to avoid divide-by-zero errors.

2005-10-26  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.5: Explicitly used Numeric's divide
	function to avoid divide-by-zero errors.

2005-10-26  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* README.txt 1.6: Updated to match current state of the code

2005-10-26  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patternfns.py 1.4, topo/base/utils.py 1.19,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.12, topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.10:
	Changed randomly worded notes about hacks to CEBHACKALERTs so JAB
	can find them when searching for 'ALERT'

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.11: Hack so that when scale is zero
	the GUI does not cause an exception. Presentation of scale-0
	patterns to the network works.

2005-10-26  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.10: Removed unused plot

2005-10-26  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.11: Added comment about pickling.

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.7: Changed some warnings and messages to
	debugs so that users don't see warnings every time they measure
	orientation maps (warnings about no plots in the retina)

2005-10-26  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.9: Added the PlotGroupTemplate for
	Preference Map

2005-10-26  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.5, topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.9: Basic
	support for pickling added; might not be required but as it is a
	snapshot of the simulator's state can be saved and then reloaded
	if topographica is started with the example in both cases. Some of
	the changes will not be permananent but these are noted.

2005-10-26  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/featuremap.py 1.8, topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py
	1.18, topo/analysis/featuremap.py 1.1: Created new file
	topo/analysis/featuremap.py from topo/base/featuremap.py and
	topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.17: Added the command
	measure_or_pref() for measuring an orientation map; improved the
	user function sinegrating_present and made it private

	* topo/outputfns/basic.py 1.6: Improved some comments

2005-10-26  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/__init__.py 1.40: Added analysis directory

	* topo/analysis/.cvsignore 1.1, topo/analysis/__init__.py 1.1:
	Initial version

2005-10-25  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.16: Made measuring maps clearer
	(changed no functionality). Still have to move sinegrating_present
	out

2005-10-25  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.10: Removed pickle support; doesn't
	seem to work yet

	* topo/base/boundingregion.py 1.4: Changed AARectangle to
	new-style class so that __slots__ is meaningful; not necessarily
	completed.  Made slots be weakly private instead of fully private;
	this appears (?) to be necessary for deepcopy

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.9: Changed indentation to match 4-space
	convention used elsewhere

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.8: Removed unused code saving the
	__dict__ for pickling, because a Parameter has no __dict__

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.11: Changed Simulator.Event to
	non-nested SimulatorEvent to avoid problems with pickle

	* examples/lissom.ty 1.50: Added running of one iteration, to
	ensure that it is tested

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.7: Added pickle support from Jeff and
	Chris

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.3, topo/base/utils.py 1.18: Moved
	classlist and descendents to utils.py for all to use

	* external/fixedpoint.diff 1.2: Added pickling support

	* external/Makefile 1.24: Made FixedPoint update more cleanly

	* topo/commands/basic.py 1.2: Made pattern_present not modify the
	simulation clock

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.14: Trivial documentation change

2005-10-24  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.15, topo/base/utils.py 1.17:
	Moved functions cross_product and frange from
	topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py to topo/base/utils.py; changed
	MeasureFeatureMap so that it works with a user-defined function
	rather than a string command; get rid of debugging statements and
	useless commentaries in measurefeaturemap

2005-10-24  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.14, topo/commands/basic.py 1.1,
	topo/patterns/patternpresent.py 1.12: Moved pattern_present to
	commands/ directory

	* topo/__init__.py 1.39: Added commands directory to default
	imports

	* topo/commands/.cvsignore 1.1, topo/commands/__init__.py 1.1:
	Initial version

	* topo/patterns/patternpresent.py 1.11: Made pattern_present save
	the input_generator by default

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.13: Minor cleanup

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.12,
	topo/patterns/patternpresent.py 1.10,
	topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.10: Renamed commands to save and
	restore input_generators.  Removed _register_inputsheet_patterns;
	didn't seem to have any reason to be a separate function

2005-10-24  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/distribution.py 1.12, topo/base/featuremap.py 1.7:
	Modified the JABHACKALERT commentaries about the use of __add__
	with the Numeric arrays

2005-10-24  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.13, examples/lissom.ty 1.49,
	topo/projections/kernelprojection.py 1.20, topo/sheets/lissom.py
	1.12: Made response_fn be declared Constant when it cannot be
	modified.  Changed name of reduce_cfsize to change_bounds.  Added
	change_density stub for future implementation.

	* topo/learningfns/basic.py 1.3: Simplified Constant declaration;
	it was confusing to say default

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.6: Trivial whitespace cleanup

	* CONVENTIONS 1.16: Minor rewording

2005-10-24  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/featuremap.py 1.6: Changed FeatureMap to work with a
	sheet instead of the activity matrix dimension; changed the test
	file accordingly

2005-10-24  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/simulator.py 1.10: Removed unused sched.scheduler
	import and variable to make pickle work

2005-10-24  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/lissom.ty 1.48, topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.12,
	topo/base/simulator.py 1.9, topo/projections/kernelprojection.py
	1.19, topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.4: An enhanced implementation of
	CFDotProduct, called CFDotProductP, that uses arrays of pointers
	to access the weights instead of through the C API. This response
	function should only be used by KernelPointerProjection, which is
	a new subclass of KernelProjection that contains the extra data
	structure to store the pointers array.

2005-10-24  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.17: Added a comment to note
	error that occurs when scale is set to 0.

	* topo/patterns/patternpresent.py 1.9: Removed accidental tab in
	the previous update.

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.11: Correction for when there
	are multiple sheets to measure maps on; updates to some comments;
	changed to work with altered pattern_present

	* topo/patterns/patternpresent.py 1.8: Changed pattern_present so
	that saving/restoring previous input patterns is done with a
	separate function; changed pattern_present so that presentations
	where learning==False no longer use a copy of the simulator's
	event list - this might be the wrong thing to have done.

	* topo/sheets/generatorsheet.py 1.9: Added a stack onto which the
	current input_generator can be placed, and from which previous
	input_generators can be restored .

2005-10-22  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/projections/kernelprojection.py 1.18: Fixed major bug:
	reduce_cfsize() was having no effect because three lines were
	omitted when it was moved from topo/cfsheet.py

2005-10-21  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

2005-10-21  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/distribution.py 1.11: Distribution now wraps vector
	directions back into the axis range. Directions used to come back
	as principal values from arctan2 - now any tests that were
	expecting the principal value rather than one within the axis
	range would fail, so they were corrected.

2005-10-21  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.6, topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.7: Made
	it legal for a plot to be empty for some (or even all) sheets

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.5: Fixed bogus behavior when no strength
	or no color was supplied; was preventing orientation maps from
	being visible

	* topo/base/topoobject.py 1.2: Added Jeff's changes to help
	pickle()

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.5: Added Jeff's changes that should

	* examples/cfsom_example.py 1.26: Corrected the mistake introduced
	in the last version.

	* examples/cfsom_example.py 1.25: Changed FuzzyLineGenerator to
	GaussianGenerator for training

2005-10-21  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* examples/cfsom_example.py 1.24: Made Retina names match between
	object and __main__, to avoid confusion.  Changed delay to 0.5 so
	that the behavior in the GUI is more reasonable

	* CONVENTIONS 1.15: Added section on docstrings and comments

2005-10-21  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.16: Removed JABHACKALERT that I
	forgot to take out when I fixed it yesterday.

2005-10-21  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.15, topo/patterns/random.py
	1.11: Simplified Constant and Random PatternGenerators

	class to emphasize what we expect to be implemented

	* examples/cfsom_example.py 1.23, examples/gui_example.py 1.34,
	examples/lissom.ty 1.47: Made default bounds match those in other

	* examples/cfsom_example.py 1.22, examples/gui_example.py 1.33,
	examples/lissom.ty 1.46: Made use DynamicNumber so that the GUI
	works again

	* examples/cfsom_example.py 1.21: Changed to use a DynamicNumber
	so that the GUI still works

	* topo/base/parameter.py 1.4: Added DynamicParameter class

	* topo/plotting/plot.py 1.4: Changed missing SheetView into a
	warning instead of a crash

	* examples/gui_example.py 1.32: Made __main__ name match the one
	inside the Retinas

2005-10-20  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.7: Added the SheetView object
	correctly; temporarily including GeneratorSheets in the preference
	and selectivity map

	loop...making available to Julien

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.5: The patterns are now
	presented as expected rather than not at all. "Lord only knows
	what idiot coded it that way!"

2005-10-20  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/patterngenerator.py 1.12: theta is defined for
	everyone.  It needs to be a Number to have soft bounds.

2005-10-19  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.4: Continued writing this
	file. At this stage, with the default_input command, the
	preference and selectivity maps are added to the relevant Sheets
	for whatever features are specified.

2005-10-19  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/patternpresent.py 1.7, topo/plotting/plotengine.py

	connection into in_projection in connection_from() only if the
	connection is a Projection.

	* topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.3: A further optimized version of
	CFDotProduct().

2005-10-19  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/patterns/patternpresent.py 1.6: Added a learning option to
	pattern_present.  Should be replaced with a function call that

	* topo/base/featuremap.py 1.4, topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.3:
	Minor addition of comments

	* topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.2: Updated some comments

2005-10-18  julienciroux  <julienciroux@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/measuredimensionmap.py 1.2,
	topo/base/measurefeaturemap.py 1.1: renamed measuredimensionmap to
	measurefeaturemap; continued implementation of MeasureFeatureMap
	in that file

	* topo/base/connectionfield.py 1.11, topo/base/projection.py 1.29,
	topo/base/simulator.py 1.8, topo/plotting/plotengine.py 1.6,
	topo/plotting/plotgroup.py 1.6, topo/sheets/cfsom.py 1.8,
	topo/sheets/lissom.py 1.11, examples/cfsom_example.py 1.20,
	examples/gui_example.py 1.31, examples/lissom.ty 1.45:
	EventProcessor now has 2 separate data stuctures (in_connections
	and out_connections) to store the incoming and outgoing
	connections.

	ProjectinSheet, a subclass of EventProcessor, has it own storage
	for incoming connection (in_projections) that are indexed by the
	source name of the projection to optimize projection lookup.

2005-10-17  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/measuredimensionmap.py 1.1: initial and incomplete
	version, probably with the wrong name. Just here so that Julien
	and Chris can both work on it

	* topo/base/featuremap.py 1.3: Changed type of preference matrices
	to Float

	* topo/base/distribution.py 1.10: Attended to some JABALERTS -

	that contains all the incoming and outgoing projections.

	* topo/base/learningrules.py 1.4, topo/responsefns/basic.py 1.2:
	add -lstdc++ when weave links the compiled C codes. This solves
	the problem when "undefined symbol" is reported during link time
	of the C code in distribution like Ubuntu 5.10.

2005-10-14  Jim Bednar  <jbednar@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	down and make a new file for them because they don't fit here all
	that well

2005-10-14  ceball  <ceball@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base/featuremap.py 1.2: continued producing initial version

	are changed to _connect_to(self, proj, **args) (similarly for
	_connect_from).

	All the subclasses of EventProcessor that invoke these methods are
	updated accordingly.

	* MILESTONES 1.6: Updated with progress

2005-07-30  jdepaula  <jdepaula@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/plotengine.py 1.15: Templates now store background info

	* topo/plot.py 1.23: Removed class that is no longer used.

	* topo/bitmap.py 1.12: Comment typo

	* topo/plotengine.py 1.14: PlotGroupTemplates are now accepted
	when creating PlotGroups

	* topo/plotgroup.py 1.8: Removed DictPlotGroup since templates are
	now implemented.

	* topo/plot.py 1.22: Added SHC plot type.  For now it's just an
	alias for an HSV map, with the channels realigned.

	* topo/plot.py 1.21: Added TODO comment about needing to allow
	multiple sheets in the SheetView sources

	* topo/plotgroup.py 1.7: Added fix for PlotGroups started with no

	* topo/plot.py 1.20: Added PlotTemplate

2005-07-21  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/cfsheet.py 1.14, topo/sheet.py 1.31: fixed cfsheet.py and
	sheet.py so that the all the unit tests are passed.

	The way that the weights in a connection field are initialized was
	changed quite significantly in the previous version of cfsheet
	(1.11). This breaks one test because the weights were assumed to
	be uniform in that version. Now the code first checks if the
	initial weight distribution is uniform random. If yes, then the
	code will follow the same flow as version 1.11. If no, the flow
	will fall back to 1.10. The main difference between these two
	version is that 1.11 implements find the set of connection field
	boundary that matched the C++ simulator and should be correct. In
	1.10, the size seems to be off by one in some cases.

	To fix the code so that all kinds of initial weight distributions
	will have the correct connection field boundary may require some
	significant changes in kernelfactory.py.

2005-07-09  yfsit  <yfsit@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/cfsheet.py 1.12, topo/sheet.py 1.30, topo/utils.py 1.6,
	examples/lissom.ty 1.15: changed cfsheet.py, sheet.py, and

	into the Projection class. The response is stored in
	temp_activation of each Projection so that it does not have to be
	computed every time. There are some simple optimizations to
	decrease the number of function calls as well.

	* topo/gui.py 1.1: Copied from LISSOM 5.0 python/.  All LISSOM
	calls commented out so the file is a driver with a lot of stubs
	and junk lines.  Only changes in this version include necessary
	fixes to get the window to open under Topographica.  Found that
	PMW 1.2 MUST be installed to work with Python 2.3 and get this
	file to run.

	2.3 required a patch to PmwMenuBar._addHotkeyToOptions that could
	not be worked around.

	* topo/dislindriver.py 1.3: Changed the three test cases so
	they'll only run if the file is Main--in other words the driver is
	now ignored, but left here as an example of how to use the
	dislinplot file.

2004-04-09  joeraii  <joeraii@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/kernelfactory.py 1.16: Added a preliminary version of fuzzy
	line, also cleaned up the remaining kernel factory definitions.

	* topo/inputsheet.py 1.11, topo/kernelfactory.py 1.15: New kernel
	factory without classes, and input sheet to reflect these changes.
	Some problems: Gabor probably doesn't work correctly, also there
	may be an issue with how parameters are being passed.

2004-04-02  joeraii  <joeraii@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/inputsheet.py 1.10, topo/kernelfactory.py 1.14: Fixed the
	90 degree rotation problem, also added a simple generator for
	doing translations. I'm not sure if it works like it should
	(i.e. if each instance of the generator is independent), however
	it does create the effect of moving a gaussian across the input
	area.

2004-03-31  joeraii  <joeraii@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/kernelfactory.py 1.13: Fixed a minor bug with the generic
	kernel factory.

	* examples/rfsom_example.py 1.2, topo/rfsom.py 1.6, topo/utils.py
	1.2: Add borders to RFSOM rf plot output.

	* Makefile 1.2, topographica 1.7, topographica-script.py 1.1:
	Changed Makefile to generate main topographica script, so it
	properly calls bin/python for each installation.

2004-03-26  joeraii  <joeraii@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/inputsheet.py 1.9: Little bug regarding TopoMetaClass
	resolved.

	* topo/kernelfactory.py 1.11: Kernel factory cleanups .

	* topo/inputsheet.py 1.6, topo/kernelfactory.py 1.10: Updated to
	work with the TopoMetaClass, however I'm currently not able to set
	the default class attributes... Also added Sheet versions of Sine
	Grating and Gabor. More functions to come.

2004-03-25  jp  <jp@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/base.py 1.2: Added TopoMetaclass, to handle class-wide
	Parameter setting.

	* topo/inputsheet.py 1.5, topo/kernelfactory.py 1.9,
	topo/params.py 1.7: Changed the kernel factory and input sheet to
	use the Parameter model. Also created some mix-in classes for
	input sheets.

	* topo/base.py 1.1: added the base module

	* examples/image_example2.py 1.5, topo/params.py 1.6,
	topo/sheet.py 1.6, topo/simulator.py 1.6: Added the .pre_sleep()
	EP method.

	* topo/rfsom.py 1.4, topo/simulator.py 1.5: RFSOM cleanup + minor

2004-03-05  nn  <nn@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/inputsheet.py 1.3, topo/kernelfactory.py 1.7: New kernel
	functions. Not completely integrated with the kernel sheet yet;
	wating for the new parameters model.

2004-02-24  nn  <nn@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/inputsheet.py 1.2, topo/kernelfactory.py 1.6: Cleaned up
	code and made the kernelfactory and inputsheet code more generic.
	Should now be trivial to begin adding other types of input sheet
	functions (other than gaussian).

2004-02-22  nn  <nn@lodestar.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* topo/params.py 1.3: Change params back to the original.

	* topo/inputsheet.py 1.1: More generic version of
	gaussiansheet.py. However it only supports gaussian kernels.

	faster, and does not crash. However it may be inconsistent in the
	ouput matrix size. This will be fixed later.
