<P>Topographica is developed by a distributed team of researchers in
the United Kingdom and the United States.  Current members of the team
include:

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar">James
      A. Bednar</a>, Lead author and project manager, 2002-</dt>
  <dd>Jim is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh.  Topographica
      is inspired by Jim's C++ <a target="_top"
      href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?lissomsw">LISSOM</a>
      simulator, but entirely reimplemented in Python for
      extensibility and generality.  Jim reviews all code and is the
      last word on the design and features.

  <p><dt>Chris Ball, September 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Chris recently received an MSc from the University of Edinburgh
      (topic: modeling motion aftereffects in LISSOM), and previously had a
      background in physics.  He is currently working on 
      input pattern types and related issues.
  <p><dt>Julien Ciroux, October 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Julien recently received an MSc from the University of Edinburgh
      (topic: modeling McCollough effect in LISSOM).  He is currently
      working on transformation functions.
  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/choe/">Yoonsuck Choe</a>, 2002-</dt>
  <dd>Yoonsuck is an Assistant Professor at Texas A&amp;M University.
      He is responsible for implementing spiking neuron support,
      primarily for integrate-and-fire neurons, and contributes
      significantly to the web site and other graphical design.
  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://porter.csres.utexas.edu/judah/">Judah De Paula</a>, 2004-</dt>
  <dd>Judah is a PhD student at the University of Texas (topic:
      modeling the development of color maps in LISSOM).  He's primarily
      responsible for implementing plotting support and other GUI items.
  <p><dt>Alan Lindsay, September 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Alan will be finishing up his undergraduate degree at the
      University of Edinburgh in 2006.  He is implementing a GUI
      interface for specifying Topographica models by selecting and
      connecting pre-defined components.
  <p><dt>Louise Mathews, September 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Louise will also be finishing up her undergraduate degree at the
      University of Edinburgh in 2006.  She is implementing published
      models of visual cortex maps (other than LISSOM).  This effort
      will help ensure that Topographica has general-purpose support
      for maps, and will build a library of starting points for future
      studies (e.g. comparison studies).
  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jp/">Jefferson
      Provost</a>, 2003-2004</dt> 
  <dd>Jeff is a PhD student at the University of Texas (topic:
      sensorimotor learning in robots).  He was the first programmer
      on the project, and wrote the initial GUI implementation (first
      in Scheme, then in Python), and most of the foundational classes
      (Sheet, CFSheet, CFSOM TopoObject, LISSOM, etc.).  He has now
      moved on to try to finish his PhD and get a job :-), but is
      still available for consulting and help on specific issues.
  <p><dt><a target="_top"
      href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/yfsit/">Yiu Fai Sit</a>,
      May 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Sit is a PhD student at the University of Texas (topic:
      the role of feedback in a hierarchical LISSOM model of V1 and
      V2).  He is responsible for making the Topographica
      implementation of LISSOM match the C++ version, and for
      improving Topographica performance.
