<P>Topographica is developed by a distributed team of researchers in
the United Kingdom and the United States.  Major contributors
include:

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar">James
      A. Bednar</a>, Lead author and project manager, 2002-</dt>
  <dd>Jim is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh.  Topographica
      was inspired by Jim's C++ <a target="_top"
      href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?lissomsw">LISSOM</a>
      simulator, but is entirely reimplemented in Python for
      extensibility and generality.  Jim reviews all code and is the
      last word on the design and features.

      Miikkulainen</a>, Principal investigator, 2002-</dt>
  <dd>Risto is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of
      Texas at Austin.

  <p><dt>Chris Ball, September 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Chris recently worked on 
      <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/v1cball/mae/lissom/">modeling
      motion aftereffects in LISSOM</a>, and now works on many different 
      parts of Topographica.  

  <p><dt>Julien Ciroux, October 2005 - April 2006</dt>
  <dd>Julien recently received an MSc from the University of Edinburgh
      (topic: modeling the McCollough effect in LISSOM).  He implemented the
      new plotting subsystem in 0.8.2 and other GUI-related functions.

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/choe/">Yoonsuck Choe</a>, 2002-</dt>
  <dd>Yoonsuck is an Assistant Professor at Texas A&amp;M University.
      He is implementing spiking neuron support,
      primarily for integrate-and-fire neurons, and contributes
      significantly to the web site and other graphical design.

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://porter.csres.utexas.edu/judah/">Judah De Paula</a>, 2004-</dt>
  <dd>Judah is a PhD student at the University of Texas (topic:
      modeling the development of color maps in LISSOM).  He was
      responsible for the initial Windows support, and implemented the
      first complete plotting and related GUI code.

  <p><dt>Alan Lindsay, September 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Alan will be finishing up his undergraduate degree at the
      University of Edinburgh in summer 2006.  Alan developed the new
      Model Editor, a graphical interface for specifying Topographica
      models by selecting and connecting pre-defined components.

  <p><dt>Louise Mathews, September 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Louise will also be finishing up her undergraduate degree at the
      University of Edinburgh in summer 2006.  She implemented sample
      models of visual cortex maps published by other research groups.
      This effort will help ensure that Topographica has
      general-purpose support for maps, and will build a library of
      starting points for future studies (e.g. comparison studies).

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jp/">Jefferson
      Provost</a>, 2003-2004</dt> 
  <dd>Jeff is a PhD student at the University of Texas (topic:
      sensorimotor learning in robots).  He wrote the initial GUI
      implementation (first in Scheme, then in Python), and the first
      Python version of most of the base classes (Sheet, CFSheet,
      CFSOM, ParameterizedObject, LISSOM, etc.).  He has now moved on
      to try to finish his PhD and get a job. :-)

  <p><dt><a target="_top"
      href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/yfsit/">Yiu Fai Sit</a>,
      May 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Sit is a PhD student at the University of Texas (topic:
      the role of feedback in a hierarchical LISSOM model of V1 and
      V2).  He was responsible for making the first Topographica
      implementation of LISSOM match the C++ version, and for
      writing C code to optimize key Topographica functions.
