<P>Topographica is developed by a distributed team of researchers in
the United Kingdom and the United States.  Current members of the team
include:

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar">James
      A. Bednar</a>, Lead author and project manager, 2002-</dt>
  <dd>Jim is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh.  Topographica
      was inspired by Jim's C++ <a target="_top"
      href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?lissomsw">LISSOM</a>
      simulator, but is entirely reimplemented in Python for
      extensibility and generality.  Jim reviews all code and is the
      last word on the design and features.

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/risto">Risto 
      Miikkulainen</a>, Principal investigator, 2002-</dt>
  <dd>Risto is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of
      Texas at Austin.

  <p><dt>Chris Ball, September 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Chris recently worked on 
      <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/s0454615/mae/lissom/">modeling
      motion aftereffects in LISSOM</a>, and now works on many different 
      parts of Topographica.  

  <p><dt>Julien Ciroux, October 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Julien recently received an MSc from the University of Edinburgh
      (topic: modeling McCollough effect in LISSOM).  He implemented the
      new plotting subsystem, and is currently working on various plotting
      extensions and GUI functions

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/choe/">Yoonsuck Choe</a>, 2002-</dt>
  <dd>Yoonsuck is an Assistant Professor at Texas A&amp;M University.
      He is responsible for implementing spiking neuron support,
      primarily for integrate-and-fire neurons, and contributes
      significantly to the web site and other graphical design.

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://porter.csres.utexas.edu/judah/">Judah De Paula</a>, 2004-</dt>
  <dd>Judah is a PhD student at the University of Texas (topic:
      modeling the development of color maps in LISSOM).  He is responsible
      for Windows support, and implemented the first complete plotting
      and related GUI support.

  <p><dt>Alan Lindsay, September 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Alan will be finishing up his undergraduate degree at the
      University of Edinburgh in 2006.  Alan is developing the new Model
      Editor, a graphical interface for specifying Topographica models
      by selecting and connecting pre-defined components.

  <p><dt>Louise Mathews, September 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Louise will also be finishing up her undergraduate degree at the
      University of Edinburgh in 2006.  She is implementing models of
      visual cortex maps published by other research groups.  This
      effort will help ensure that Topographica has general-purpose
      support for maps, and will build a library of starting points
      for future studies (e.g. comparison studies).

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jp/">Jefferson
      Provost</a>, 2003-2004</dt> 
  <dd>Jeff is a PhD student at the University of Texas (topic:
      sensorimotor learning in robots).  He was the first programmer
      on the project, and wrote the initial GUI implementation (first
      in Scheme, then in Python), and the first version of most of the
      base classes (Sheet, CFSheet, CFSOM TopoObject, LISSOM, etc.).
      He has now moved on to try to finish his PhD and get a job :-),
      but is still available for consulting and help on specific
      issues.

  <p><dt><a target="_top"
      href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/yfsit/">Yiu Fai Sit</a>,
      May 2005-</dt>
  <dd>Sit is a PhD student at the University of Texas (topic:
      the role of feedback in a hierarchical LISSOM model of V1 and
      V2).  He is responsible for making the Topographica
      implementation of LISSOM match the C++ version, and for
      improving Topographica performance.
