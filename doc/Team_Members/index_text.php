<P>Topographica is developed by a distributed team of researchers in
the United Kingdom and the United States.  The principal developers are:

<dl>
  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar">James
      A. Bednar</a>, Lead author and project manager, 2002 - </dt>
  <dd>Jim is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh.  Topographica
      was inspired by Jim's C++ 
      <a target="_top" href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?lissomsw">LISSOM</a>
      simulator in use from 1995-2004, but has been entirely reimplemented in
      Python for extensibility and generality.  Jim reviews all code
      and is the last word on the design and features.  <br> <br>

  <p><dt>Jan Antolik, September 2006 - </dt>
  <dd>Jan is working on his PhD thesis about feedback from V2 to V1 at the
      University of Edinburgh, but also contributes optimizations and
      other code to Topographica.

  <p><dt>Chris Ball, September 2005 - </dt>
  <dd>Chris has worked on nearly every part of Topographica.  Since
      September 2008 he has been a PhD student in Edinburgh, working on
      modeling the development of color and motion preference maps.

  <p><dt>Judith Law, September 2005 - </dt>
  <dd>Judith is working on her PhD thesis about V1 surround modulation
      and species differences at the University of Edinburgh, but also
      contributed tuning curve support and various GUI improvements.

  <p><dt>Chris Palmer, September 2005 - </dt>
  <dd>Chris is working on his PhD thesis about spatial frequency
      representations in V1 at the University of Edinburgh, but also
      maintains receptive field plotting support and other analysis code.

  <p><dt>Roger Zhao, September 2006 - </dt>
  <dd>Roger is working on his PhD thesis about face aftereffects at the
      University of Edinburgh, and contributes face-related code to
      Topographica. He also helps out with Mac OS X support.

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/risto">Risto 
      Miikkulainen</a>, Principal investigator, 2002 - 2005</dt>
  <dd>Risto is a Professor of Computer Science at the University of
      Texas at Austin.

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/choe/">Yoonsuck Choe</a>, 2002 - </dt>
  <dd>Yoonsuck is an Assistant Professor at Texas A&amp;M University.
      He implemented preliminary spiking neuron support,
      primarily for integrate-and-fire neurons, and also contributed
      significantly to the web site and other graphical design.

  <p><dt>Julien Ciroux, October 2005 - April 2006</dt>
  <dd>Julien received an MSc from the University of Edinburgh
      (topic: modeling the McCollough effect in LISSOM).  He implemented the
      plotting subsystem in 0.8.2 and other GUI-related functions.

  <p><dt>Foivos Demertzis, September 2006 - May 2007</dt>
  <dd>Foivos completed his undergraduate degree at the
      University of Edinburgh, including a project of developing
      more sample models for Topographica.

  <p><dt>Kateryna Gerasymova, May 2008 - September 2008</dt>
  <dd>In a MSc-level project in collaboration with Humboldt University
      (Berlin), Kateryna implemented numerous separate and joint maps
      and analysis routines, e.g. for direction, ocular dominance, and
      color.

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://porter.csres.utexas.edu/judah/">Judah De Paula</a>, 2004 - 2006</dt>
  <dd>Judah completed his PhD at the University of Texas (topic:
      modeling the development of color maps in LISSOM).  He was
      responsible for the initial Windows support, and implemented the
      first complete plotting and related GUI code.

  <p><dt>Alan Lindsay, September 2005 - May 2006</dt>
  <dd>Alan finished his undergraduate degree at the
      University of Edinburgh in summer 2006.  Alan developed the 
      Model Editor, a graphical interface for specifying Topographica
      models by selecting and connecting pre-defined components.

  <p><dt>Louise Mathews, September 2005 - May 2006</dt>
  <dd>Louise finished her undergraduate degree at the
      University of Edinburgh in summer 2006.  She implemented sample
      models of visual cortex maps published by other research groups.

  <p><dt>Ruaidhri Primrose, September 2006 - May 2007</dt>
  <dd>Ruaidrhi completed his undergraduate degree at the
      University of Edinburgh, including a project of developing
      more sample models for Topographica.

  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~jp/">Jefferson
      Provost</a>, 2002 - 2008</dt> 
  <dd>Jeff worked on Topographica as a postdoctoral researcher in the
      Neuroscience Department at the University of Pittsburgh, and
      earlier at the University of Texas at Austin.  He wrote the
      initial GUI implementation (first in Scheme, then in Python),
      and the first Python version of most of the base classes (Sheet,
      CFSheet, CFSOM, Parameterized, LISSOM, etc.), plus support
      for robotics interfacing and for non-uniform projection mappings.

  <p><dt><a target="_top"
      href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/yfsit/">Yiu Fai Sit</a>,
      May 2005 - 2006</dt>
  <dd>Sit is a PhD student at the University of Texas (topic:
      the role of feedback in a hierarchical LISSOM model of V1 and
      V2).  He was responsible for making the first Topographica
      implementation of LISSOM match the C++ version, and for
      writing C code to optimize key Topographica functions.
