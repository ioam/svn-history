  <p><dt><a target="_top" href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbednar">James
      A. Bednar</a>, Lead author and project manager, 2002 - </dt>
  <dd>Jim is a Lecturer at the University of Edinburgh.  Parts of

      <a target="_top" href="http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/keyword?lissomsw">LISSOM</a>
      simulator in use from 1995-2004, but Topographica was entirely
      reimplemented in Python for extensibility and generality.  Jim
      reviews all code and is the last word on the design and
      features.
