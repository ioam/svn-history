<H1>Topographica representations of time</H1>

Topographica is designed to support both clocked and event-driven
simulations.  This section describes these types of simulation, and
then explains the structure of Topographica simulations of both types.

<H2>Clocked simulations</H2>

<P>Computer simulations of causal physical processes happening over a
time period are typically either <i>clocked</i> or <i>event-driven</i>.
A clocked simulation quantizes time into discrete steps, typically
equally spaced.  Such an approach is a good way to approximate a
continuous process, as long as the timestep is small enough.  For
instance, a clocked simulator could use a timebase of 1 millisecond
(ms), and would simulate the properties of the physical system at 0
ms, 1 ms, etc:

<P>At each multiple of the timestep, the state of the system is
explicitly represented, and then used to calculate the state one time
step in the future.

<P>Clocked simulations are appropriate primarily when the physical
events of interest occur at relatively uniformly distributed times.
On the other hand, if the most important physical events occur at
widely spaced intervals, a clocked simulator is not very efficient.  A
clocked simulator must either simulate many unwanted time steps
between interesting events, or else use a large time step and thus
have only limited detail during the interesting events.

<H2>Event-driven simulations</H2>

<P>Discrete event-driven simulators have the opposite features. Such
simulators explicitly model only isolated events, ignoring long
periods with little of interest in between.  For instance, such
simulators are often used for modeling neuron membrane potentials, which
change relatively slowly for long periods, but then quickly vary over
a large range during a sudden firing event.  An event-driven simulator
can devote more timesteps to such interesting events, without spending
extra time in between.  For instance, such a simulator might
explicitly calculate only the points listed here, skipping the times
in between:

<H2>Topographica simulations</H2>

<P>Topographica is designed to support both major types of
simulations.  For full generality, the underlying architecture is
event driven, because it is possible to use an event-driven simulator
for clocked simulations (by treating clock ticks as events), but not
vice versa.

<P>A Topographica simulation consists of:

<DL COMPACT>
  <DT><B>An Event Queue:</B>
  <DD>A single globally ordered list of all events scheduled to occur in the
    future on the timeline; not normally accessed by a user.<BR><BR>
    
  <DT><B>EventProcessors:</B>
  <DD>Objects (typically <?php classref('topo.base.sheet','Sheet')
    ?>s) capable of sending and/or receiving discrete Events.<BR><BR>
    
  <DT><B>Events:</B>
  <DD>Messages that can be delivered to an EventProcessor at a
    specified time.<BR><BR>
    
  <DT><B>Connections:</B>
  <DD>Links between EventProcessors along which Events are passed
    after a (typically) fixed delay.
</DL>

<P>For instance, a typical Topographica simulation will consist of
a set of <?php classref('topo.base.sheet','Sheet') ?>s connected into
a graph with fixed delays:

<P><CENTER><IMG BORDER="2" WIDTH="519" HEIGHT="424" SRC="images/toplevel.png"></CENTER>

<P>For a clocked simulation, at least one of these EventProcessors
(typically an input Sheet like the Retina in this example) will
generate a regular series of Events, which will cause events to be
sent out over the Connections, at which point the EventProcessors will
likely create new Events and send them out over their own connections,
leading to a cascade of activity.

<P>For instance, in this example, if the event queue were initally
empty but the Retina generated an event at time zero, the next
computation would occur at simulated time d1 or d2, when the first
event arrives at the ON or OFF sheet.  Subsequent events would be
delivered along each of the connections, causing each Sheet to be
activated in turn.

<P>Event-driven simulations are nearly identical to this, except that
instead of a regular stream of input events they will be given an
irregular stream consisting of only the important events.
EventProcessors will then calculate their state at each event based on
the preceding events and the elapsed time.  Events will still
propagate as before, but not on any regular timebase.

<P>By convention, the delays in clocked Topographica simulations are
typically set up so that the user-visible state is visible on even
multiples of 1.0 time. For instance, a two-Sheet simulation with a
Retina and V1 might be set up to have a Connection with delay 0.5, so
that the event is generated in the retina at time zero, then delivered to
V1 at time 0.5, so that V1's response will be ready for visualization
by time 1.0.

<P>To study the individual events that are generated during the
simulation, you can <a href="commandline.html#min_print_level">enable verbose
messaging</a>.
