<P> Starting from March 2012 (revision 11906), Topographica supports multiple core processors using the OpenMP library (<A HREF="http://openmp.org/wp/">openmp.org</A>). This functionality can result in significant speedup when running simulations on multicore machines. Enabling OpenMP will not prevent Topographica from working as normal on single core machines or on multicore machines that lack the necessary OpenMP libraries and compiler support.

<H2>OpenMP in Topographica</H2>

Using OpenMP in Topographica is straightforward, requiring a single flag to enable OpenMP and a single (optional) variable to control the number of threads used. To get the most out of your multicore system, it is important to understand that enabling OpenMP does not guarantee the best possible performance: in some situations you may find using multiple concurrent but single-threaded instances of Topographica will complete the desired set of simulations quicker.

<H3>Installing OpenMP</H3>

The OpenMP library is supported and shipped with recent versions of most modern compilers. To check if your compiler can support OpenMP, please consult the list of compatible compilers at <A HREF="http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-compilers/">openmp.org</A>. If you find OpenMP cannot be enabled with Topographica, you may be running an older compiler version. In this case, you should consider updating your compiler and making sure the necessary library files are installed for your particular distribution or operating system.

<!-- ldconfig -p | grep -i "gomp" -->
<!-- sudo apt-get install gcc libgomp1 -->

<H3>Enabling OpenMP</H3>

OpenMP is enabled and disabled via the global "openmp" variable in the Topographica environment using '-c openmp=True' at the commandline. To illustrate this with the example model (tiny.ty), monitor your processor usage (eg. using top or htop on Linux) after running the following command:

<pre>
./topographica -c 'openmp=True' -g ./examples/tiny.ty -c 'topo.sim.run(10000)'
</pre>

You should see that all available cores are in use for the duration of the simulation and you may notice some loss of responsiveness on your system while the simulation is running. The default OpenMP behaviour to use all available cores when enabled unless a lower number of threads has been manually specified (as described shortly). Note that when using the GUI, it is important to place the '-g' flag <i>after</i> you specify '-c openmp=True'. If you try the following command, you will notice that only one core is in uses, contrary to what you might expect:

<pre>
./topographica -g -c 'openmp=True' ./examples/tiny.ty -c 'topo.sim.run(10000)'
</pre>

This problem can be avoided if you always check that the string 'Using OpenMP' is printed to the terminal as soon as Topographica is launched.

<H3>Setting the number of threads</H3>

The proper way to reduce the number of threads used by OpenMP in Topographica is to set the 'openmp_threads' variable to the appropriate positive integer value. This can be useful if you want to leave a core free to maintain responsiveness on your system over the course of a simulation. Here is an example of how the number of threads used can be set to two:

<pre>
./topographica  -c openmp_threads=2 -c openmp=True -g ./examples/tiny.ty -c 'topo.sim.run(10000)'
</pre>

If the number of OpenMP threads is not set explicitly in this way, the 'OMP_NUM_THREADS' environment variable  is consulted (if it exists). To illustrate, the following simulation will only use two cores:

<pre>
OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./topographica  -c openmp=True -p seed_val=42 -g ./examples/gcal.ty
</pre>

The OMP_NUM_THREADS environment variable is designed to be a system-wide setting. For this reason, explicit use of "openmp_threads" is prefered unless there is good reason to use the system-wide default.

<H3>When to use OpenMP</H3>

OpenMP is very useful when you have to run a single, long-running simulation and do not wish to leave multiple cores on your system idle. When you have a batch of simulations to run, it is important to understand that using N threads per simulation does not mean each simulation will complete N times quicker. In some circumstances, running N single-threaded Topographica instances concurrently may help you complete your batch of simulations quicker. Furthermore, you are likely to find ever diminishing returns as you increase the number of OpenMP threads per Topographica instance. This is one of the reasons you may wish to leave at least one core free in order to keep the rest of the system responsive.
<P> 
The scalability of OpenMP will vary depending on the computing environment used, the model definition and the particular parameters of the simulation (eg. cortex_density) as there are many possible tradeoffs between memory usage, number of threads and number of cores. One simplistic rule of thumb is to try and launch many independent simulations as long as you launch fewer simulations than available cores and you do not run out of memory - swapping will always result in major slowdown. Each core will work most efficiently if it is running an independent simulation with an independent block of memory, provided that memory consumption is not the bottleneck. Unfortunately, in Topographica, this is rarely the case. 

<P>If multiple cores are assigned to a single simulation, the cores are likely to have some memory contention as they are operating on the same block of memory. This explains why each extra core results in a smaller boost in performance. The fundamental problem, however, is that Topographica simulations are often memory-bound, making memory-access the major bottleneck regardless of the number of cores available or how they are used. In summary, it is worth keeping these issues in mind when using OpenMP and you may find it worthwhile to benchmark you system for your own simulations.
