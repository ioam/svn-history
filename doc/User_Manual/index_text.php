<P>Although the relevant information is available in the reference
manual, with the tutorial as a guide, it can be difficult to figure
out the underlying principles and appropriate way to use Topographica.
To clarify these issues, a detailed user manual is currently under
development (as of 2/2006), and will be posted here when it is
usable.
