Although the relevant information is available in the reference
manual, with the tutorial as a guide, it can be difficult to figure
out the underlying principles and appropriate way to use Topographica.
To clarify these issues, a detailed user manual is currently under
development (as of 11/2005), and will be posted here when it is
usable.

<!-- 
Need to add:

  - Figure A.1 from miikkulainen:book05.
  - Network diagrams from ~/ueinf/research/papers/topographica/slides.tex
  - Description from: ~/ueinf/research/papers/cns03-sw/paper.tex
  - Some motivation from: ~/ueinf/research/papers/sfn02/field.tex
  - Features from ~/ueinf/research/papers/sfn02/sw.tex

Need to make a Downloads page, and add info about CVS version of
Topographica to it, plus mention that there will eventually be 
downloadable packages.

Link to book.
