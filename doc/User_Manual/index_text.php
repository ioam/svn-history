Under construction.
<!-- 
Need to add:

  - Figure A.1 from miikkulainen:book05.
  - Network diagrams from ~/ueinf/research/papers/topographica/slides.tex
  - Description from: ~/ueinf/research/papers/cns03-sw/paper.tex
  - Some motivation from: ~/ueinf/research/papers/sfn02/field.tex
  - Features from ~/ueinf/research/papers/sfn02/sw.tex

Need to make a Downloads page, and add info about CVS version of
Topographica to it, plus mention that there will eventually be 
downloadable packages.

Link to book.
