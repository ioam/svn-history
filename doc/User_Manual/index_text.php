Although the relevant information is available in the reference
manual, with the tutorial as a guide, it can be difficult to figure
out the underlying principles and appropriate way to use Topographica.
To clarify these issues, a detailed user manual is currently under
development (as of 11/2005), and will be posted here when it is
usable.

<!--
 First, general motivation and background (why use Topographica?  Why not?)

 Sheets
 sheet coordinates, densities, bounding boxes
 event-driven simulator, time scale
 class parameters
 instance/constructor parameters
 How to define a new simulator
 Hierarchy diagram: the major classes that matter
 Lots of examples

 Starting point:
  1) existing model, want to make a change, or
  2) biological system, want to model it
      - Need to choose sheets, projections, properties from existing list, then
      - Need to analyze how it behaves (plotting, statistics, etc.), then
      - Depending on how well it fills the needs, need to be able to add
          new primitives or edit existing ones
      - Produce figures, tables, etc. for publication

    
 
Need to add:

  - Figure A.1 from miikkulainen:book05.
  - Network diagrams from ~/ueinf/research/papers/topographica/slides.tex
  - Description from: ~/ueinf/research/papers/cns03-sw/paper.tex
  - Some motivation from: ~/ueinf/research/papers/sfn02/field.tex
  - Features from ~/ueinf/research/papers/sfn02/sw.tex

Need to make a Downloads page, and add info about CVS version of
Topographica to it, plus mention that there will eventually be 
downloadable packages.

Link to book.
