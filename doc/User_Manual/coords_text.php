<H1>ImaGen spatial coordinate systems</H1>

ImaGen supports resolution-independent specification and generation of
input patterns.  To achieve this, ImaGen provides multiple
spatial coordinate systems, called <i>Sheet</i> and <i>matrix</i>
coordinates.


<H2><A NAME="sheet-coords">Sheet coordinates</A></H2>

<P>User-accessible quantities are always expressed in Sheet
coordinates, which are resolution independent.  A ImaGen <?php
classref('imagen.sheetcoords','SheetCoordinateSystem') ?> is a rectangularly
bounded region of a continuous two-dimensional plane.  The default
SheetCoordinateSystem has a square area of 1.0 centered at (0.0,0.0):

<P><CENTER><IMG BORDER="2" WIDTH="324" HEIGHT="325" SRC="images/sheet_coords.png"></CENTER>

<P>Locations in a SheetCoordinateSystem are specified using floating-point Sheet
coordinates (x,y) contained within the SheetCoordinateSystem's <?php
classref('imagen.boundingregion','BoundingBox') ?>.  The thick
black line in the figure above shows the BoundingBox of the default
SheetCoordinateSystem, which extends from (-0.5,-0.5) to (0.5,0.5) in Sheet
coordinates.  Any coordinate within the BoundingBox is a valid Sheet
coordinate.


<H2><A NAME="matrix-coords">Matrix coordinates</A></H2>

<P>Although users primarily manipulate the abstract, continuous
SheetCoordinateSystem, the actual output from a PatternGenerator is a
finite matrix that regularly samples this continuous space.  Each
SheetCoordinateSystem has a parameter called its <i>density</i>, which
specifies how many units (matrix elements) in the matrix correspond to
a unit length in Sheet coordinates.  For instance, the default
SheetCoordinateSystem above with a density of 5 corresponds to the
matrix on the left below:

<P><CENTER>
<IMG BORDER="2" WIDTH="324" HEIGHT="325" SRC="images/matrix_coords.png">
<IMG BORDER="2" WIDTH="324" HEIGHT="325" SRC="images/sheet_coords_-0.2_0.4.png">
</CENTER>

<P>Here, the 1.0x1.0 area of Sheet coordinates is represented by a 5x5
matrix, whose BoundingBox (represented by a thick black outline)
corresponds exactly to the BoundingBox of the Sheet to which it
belongs.  Each floating-point location (x,y) in Sheet coordinates
corresponds uniquely to a floating-point location (r,c) in
floating-point matrix coordinates, and vice versa.  Individual units
or elements in this array are accessed using integer <i>matrix
index</i> coordinates, which can be calculated from the matrix
coordinate <code>(r,c)</code> as
(<code>floor(int(r))</code>,<code>floor(int(c))</code>).

<P>For the example shown, the center of the unit with matrix index
(0,1) is at location (0.5,1.5) in matrix coordinates and (-0.2,0.4) in
Sheet coordinates.  Notice that matrix and matrix index coordinates
start at (0.0,0.0) in the upper left and increase down and to the
right (as is the accepted convention for matrices), while Sheet
coordinates start at the center and increase up and to the right (as
is the accepted convention for Cartesian coordinates).

<P>The reason for having multiple sets of coordinates is that the same
SheetCoordinateSystem can at another time yield a different matrix
specified by a different density.  For instance, if this
SheetCoordinateSystem had a density of 10 instead, the corresponding
matrix would be:

<P><CENTER>
<IMG BORDER="2" WIDTH="324" HEIGHT="325" SRC="images/matrix_coords_hidensity.png">
<IMG BORDER="2" WIDTH="324" HEIGHT="325" SRC="images/sheet_coords_-0.2_0.4.png">
</CENTER>

<P>Using this higher density, Sheet coordinate (-0.2,0.4) now
corresponds to the matrix coordinate (1.0,3.0).  As long as the user
interface specifies all units in Sheet coordinates and converts these
to matrix coordinates appropriately, the user can use different
densities at different times without changing any other parameters.


<H3><A NAME="coord-details">Technical details</A></H3>

<P>In some cases, the details of representing a SheetCoordinateSystem
with a matrix of a certain density can be more complex than described
above, because it is possible to specify a bounds and density
combination that cannot be realized exactly.  For this reason, the
quantities set by the user are called <code>nominal_density</code> and
<code>nominal_bounds</code>, and the true bounds and density are
calculated from these.

<P>For instance, consider requesting that a SheetCoordinateSystem have bounds of
<code>BoundingBox(radius=0.3)</code>, and density of <code>7</code>.
Such an area (a 0.6 x 0.6 square) cannot be tiled exactly by 7 units
per 1.0 length. When such a SheetCoordinateSystem is created, the density will be adjusted
so that the requested sheet bounds (and thus the overall area) is
respected. In this example, the SheetCoordinateSystem would have an actual density of
6.67 (the closest value to tile the plane exactly; see <?php
classref('imagen.sheetcoords','SheetCoordinateSystem')?>).  This
approach was chosen so that whenever the density is changed, the
matrix remains the best possible approximation of the requested
area.

<P>In summary, the bounds specified for a SheetCoordinateSystem are
respected, but the density may be adjusted so that the plane is tiled
exactly.
