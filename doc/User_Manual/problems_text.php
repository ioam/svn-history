<H1>Problems using Topographica</H1>

<P>Some introductory paragraph (what's on this page?).</P>

[Can't work out how to do something specific: support requests forum;
Want to discuss something else: open discussion, etc. What to do before
filing a feature request.]


<H2>Reporting problems with Topographica</H2>

<P>When you have found what appears to be a problem with Topographica
itself, please try the following:

<ol>

<li>First, you could search the list of <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=53602&atid=470929">bug
reports</a> on our project pages at SourceForge to see if we already
know about the problem. If you find the problem, please feel free to
add additional comments.</li>

<li>We also have a <a
href="http://topographica.org/Future_Work/current.html">task list</a>,
used by the developers to keep track of tasks. Try searching this list
for information about your problem. If you find a related task, please
send an e-mail to the developers [**link].</li>

<li>Next, maybe you're using an old version, and the problem you
have has since been fixed? [** Where can a user easily look to see if
a bug was fixed? The changelog? Search the cvs mailings? Update to the
latest cvs version on another copy? Email the developers?]  </li>

<li>Once you're reasonably sure the problem is not one already
mentioned somewhere, please file a bug report by following the link in
(1). For someone to help with your problem, we need to be able to
replicate it. Please include:
<ul>
<li>the full error message;
<li>the output of <code>cvs diff</code>;
<li>any additional file needed to replicate the problem (e.g. a script you're using).</li>
</ul>
To maximize the speed of resolution, please first try to reduce the differences
between your copy of topographica and [**the original version/the one on cvs] to the
minimum required to elicit [**right word?] the problem (e.g. by removing extra parts of a model, 
removing other changes that do not affect the problem, reducing sheet densities, and so on.)
</li>
<li>Something about the tracking, what to do if you get no response, and so on.</li>

</ol>

</P>
