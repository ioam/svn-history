<H1>Topographica spatial coordinate systems</H1>

Topographica allows simulation parameters to be specified in units
that are independent of the level of detail used in any particular run
of the simulation.  To achieve this, Topographica provides multiple
spatial coordinate systems, called <i>Sheet</i> and <i>matrix</i>
coordinates.  These coordinate systems are primarily described in the
<a href="coords.html">ImaGen package</a>, which should be examined
before going further on this page.  Here we describe only the
Topographica-specific aspects of the coordinate systems.


<H2><A NAME="connection-fields">Connection fields</A></H2>

Units in a Topographica Sheet can receive input from units in other
Sheets.  Such inputs are generally contained within a 
<?php classref('topo.base.cf','ConnectionField') ?>, which is a
spatially localized region of an input Sheet.  A ConnectionField is
bounded by a BoundingBox that is a subregion of the Sheet's
BoundingBox.  The units contained within a ConnectionField are those
whose centers lie within that BoundingBox.

<P>For instance, if the user specifies a ConnectionField with Sheet bounds from
(-0.275,-0.0125) to (0.025,0.2885) for a sheet with a density of 10, the
corresponding matrix coordinate bounds are (5.125,2.250) to (2.125,5.250):

<P>Here the medium black outline shows the user-specified
ConnectionField BoundingBox in matrix and Sheet coordinates.  The
units contained in this ConnectionField are (4,2) to (2,4) (inclusive;
shown by black dots with a yellow background).  Notice that the Sheet
area of the ConnectionField will not necessarily correspond exactly to
the user-specified BoundingBox, because the matrix is discrete.

<P>Note that a ConnectionField is similar to the biological concept of
a receptive field (RF), but the two concepts are the same only for
models with one input sheet and one cortical sheet.  When there is
more than one hierarchical level, the ConnectionField of a top-level
unit is a set of weights on the previous Sheet, while the receptive
field is an area of the input sheet to which the unit responds.  Thus
a ConnectionField is a lower-level concept than a receptive field, and
RFs can be thought of as constructed from CFs.

<H2><A NAME="edge-buffers">Edge buffering</A></H2>

<P>If every Sheet has the default 1.0x1.0 area, units near the border
of higher-level Sheets will have ConnectionFields that extend past the
border of lower-level Sheets.  This ConnectionField cropping will
often result in artifacts in the behavior of units near the border.
To avoid such artifacts, lower-level Sheets should usually have areas
larger than 1.0x1.0.

<P>For instance, assume that Sheets have a 1.0x1.0 area.  If a 
higher level sheet U has a ConnectionField BoundingBox of size 0.4x0.4
on lower-level Sheet L, neurons near the border of U will have up to
0.2 in Sheet coordinates cut off of their ConnectionFields.  To prevent
this, the BoundingBox of L can be extended by 0.2 in Sheet
coordinates in each direction:

<P><CENTER><IMG BORDER="2" WIDTH="407" HEIGHT="404" SRC="images/retina_edge_buffer.png"></CENTER>

<P>Here, the thick black line shows the calculated size of L to avoid
edge cropping, and the dotted line shows the size of U for reference.
If L were the size of U, up to three quarters of the ConnectionField
of units in U near the border would be cut off.  With the size of L
extended as shown, all units in U will have full ConnectionFields.
Thus when calculating the behavior of U, the extended L will work as
if L were infinitely large in all directions.  This approach is
appropriate for avoiding edge effects when modeling a small patch of a
larger system.

<P>Of course, this technique cannot help you avoid such cropping for
lateral connections within U or feedback connections from areas above
U.  In some simulators, periodic boundary conditions can be enforced
such that such connections wrap around like a torus, avoiding these
issues. However, such wrapping is not practical in Topographica, which
focuses on drawing realistic input patterns like photographs, which
cannot be rendered properly on a torus.


<H3><A NAME="coord-details">Technical details</A></H3>

<P> In addition to the details discussed with the
<a href="coords.html#coord-details">ImaGen package</a>, Topographica
Sheets have an additional complication for certain bounds and
densities when using non-square sheets.  Consider the example from
ImaGen, but instead with rectangular bounds given by
<code>BoundingBox(points=((-0.3,-0.5),(0.3,0.5)))</code>. This time,
the y dimension would be tiled exactly by a density of 7, but the x
dimension would not. This problem could be solved by allowing a Sheet
to have different densities in each dimension (i.e. an xdensity and a
ydensity); indeed, the <?php
classref('imagen.sheetcoords','SheetCoordinateSystem')?> underlying a
Sheet does not require that the xdensity and ydensity are
equal. However, for a Sheet itself, it is simpler for the density to
be equal in both dimensions. To solve the problem above, then,
Topographica takes the bounds's x-width and calculate an xdensity from
this (as described for the previous example), and makes the ydensity
exactly equal to this by adjusting the top and bottom bounds. In our
example, the top bound would be adjusted to 0.525, and the bottom to
-0.525---the closest bounds allowing a density of 6.67 to tile the
dimension exactly.

<P>In summary, the bounds specified for a Sheet are respected, but the
density may be adjusted so that the plane is tiled exactly. 
In certain cases where it is not possible to have
the same density in the y direction as in the x direction with the specified
bounds, the top and bottom bounds are adjusted so that the densities can 
remain equal. This is an
"x-bounds-master" approach; futher discussion of this and alternatives
is available in <?php classref('imagen.sheetcoords','SheetCoordinateSystem')?>.
