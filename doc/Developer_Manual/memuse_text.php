<H1>Memory usage</H1>

<P>In many cases, the factor that determines whether a Topographica
simulation will be practical is its memory usage.  Once a simulation
is larger than the system memory, it will be entirely impractical, if
not impossible, to run on a given machine.  Moreover, runtime can
often be improved by reducing memory requirements, because much of the
simulation time is taken performing simple, fast operations on a large
number of items, which is dominated by the memory bandwidth.

<P>Topographica provides several utilities for measuring memory usage
<?php moduleref('topo.misc.memuse')?>,
and these can be used to optimize specific parts of the code to reduce
memory requirements.  Some of these currently (6/2009) only work on
UNIX-like systems, but it should be straightforward to provide similar
functionality for other operating systems.  This page first discusses
utilities that can help you determine your total memory requirements
and whether optimizing these is possible, and then briefly discusses
how to optimize them.


<H2>Topsize</H2>

<P>On a UNIX-like system, you can measure the total real memory of any
process using the <code>top</code> command.  For instance, if you have
started Topographica's copy of Python using <code>./bin/python</code>,
top returns:

<pre>
  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND           
 4060 jbednar   17   0  7684 2780 1676 S    0  0.1   0:00.00 python             
</pre>

Here RES indicates that a minimal Python process takes 2,780 bytes on
this machine, i.e. much less than one megabyte of system memory.

<P>Topographica provides a command 
<?php fnref('topo.misc.memuse','topsize') ?> to extract this
number automatically for the python process from which it is run:

<pre>
$ bin/python -c 'execfile("topo/misc/memuse.py") ; print topsize()'
2908
</pre>

<P>Here the number is slightly higher than before because Python has
now executed <code>memuse.py</code>, which requires importing some
libraries.  The ./topographica script imports many additional
libraries by default, and so the process size for running
./topographica is much higher than for python alone:

<pre>
$ ./topographica -c 'from topo.misc import memuse' -c 'print memuse.topsize_mb()'
topsize:10m
</pre>

<P>Here the <code>m</code> indicates that the size is 10 megabytes,
i.e. about 10.5 million bytes.  The requirements rise further if most
of the commands are imported at the start:

<pre>
$ ./topographica -a -c 'from topo.misc import memuse, asizeof' -c 'print memuse.topsize_mb()'
topsize:25m
</pre>
  
<P>For this particular version of Topographica, 25MB should be
considered the minimal process size for any real network run without a
GUI, and sizes below that number are likely to be possible only by
selecting components that avoid importing system libraries.  In any
case, most modern computers have at least 1024MB of memory, and so
this overhead should rarely be significant.


<H2>Simsize and asizeof</H2>

The total process size from 
<?php fnref('topo.misc.memuse','topsize') ?> has the biggest effect
on whether a simulation is practical, but it's crucial to know what
Python/Topographica components make up the total.  The <?php
fnref('topo.misc.asizeof','asizeof') ?> function can be used to
estimate the size of any Python object in Python 2.5 or earlier, e.g.:

<pre>
>>> from topo.misc.asizeof import asizeof
>>> asizeof([])
40
>>> asizeof([1,2,3,4,5,6])
176
</pre>

Python 2.6 provides a method <code>sys.getsizeof</code> that appears
to work similarly but has not been tested.

<P><code>asizeof</code> has many limitations, and it will
systematically underestimate the requirements when there are parts of
objects for which the memory use is not known.  In particular, asizeof
does not currently account for any memory taken by Numpy array values:

<pre>
>>> from topo.misc.asizeof import asizeof
>>> from numpy import array
>>> asizeof(array([]))
40
>>> asizeof(array([1,2,3,4,5,6]))
40
topo_t000000.00_c10>>> asizeof(array([0]*10000))
40
</pre>

All Topographica weights and activity values are stored in numpy
arrays, and so this omission can be significant.

<P>In any case, Topographica provides a function 
<?php fnref('topo.misc.memuse','simsize') ?> for measuring
<code>asizeof(topo.sim)</code>:

<pre>
$ ./topographica -a -c 'from topo.misc import memuse, asizeof' examples/tiny.ty \
-c 'print memuse.simsize()'
48800
</pre>

Again, this value does not include any arrays, which are counted by
<?php fnref('topo.command','n_bytes') ?> 
(below).


<H2>n_bytes, n_conns, and print_sizes</H2>

The above routines are meant to be very general, albeit flawed.
Topographica also provides Topographica-specific functions for
counting the number of bytes taken by the main Numpy arrays, which
constitute the major necessary data structures required for simulating
networks.

<P>
The estimated number of bytes taken for the weights and activity
arrays can be found from the 
<?php fnref('topo.command','n_bytes') ?> command:

<pre>
$ ./topographica -a examples/lissom_oo_or.ty -c 'print n_bytes()'
15908552
</pre>

<P>As an aside, you can determine how many neural connections have
been defined using the
<?php fnref('topo.command','n_conns') ?> command:

<pre>
$ ./topographica -a examples/lissom_oo_or.ty -c 'print n_conns()'
2197512
</pre>

The results from 
<?php fnref('topo.command','n_conns') ?> and 
<?php fnref('topo.command','n_bytes') ?> are reported by
default for batch simulations using the 
<?php fnref('topo.command','print_sizes') ?> command:

<pre>
$ ./topographica -a examples/lissom_oo_or.ty -c 'print_sizes()'
Defined 2197512-connection network; 15MB required for weight storage.
</pre>

Note that 
<?php fnref('topo.command','n_conns') ?> reports the total
number of connections defined, unique or not; for simulations like
<code>lissom_oo_or.ty</code> that include a
<?php classref('topo.projection','SharedWeightCFProjection')?> the 
memory taken can be far less than the number of weights would
suggest because most of the connections share the same physical
memory.


<H2>allsizes_mb and memuse_batch: total memory usage</H2>

As should be clear from the above, a complete picture of the memory
usage is possible only by combining information from different
sources.  Topographica provides a convenient way to do so via the
<?php fnref('topo.misc.memuse','allsizes_mb') ?> command:

<pre>  
$ ./topographica -a -c 'from topo.misc import memuse, asizeof' \
examples/lissom_oo_or.ty -c 'print memuse.allsizes_mb()'
topsize:52m =? code + simsize:10MB + wtsize:15MB (25MB tot)
</pre>

<P>Here the total process size (reported by top) is 52MB.  This total
includes memory taken by the code and libraries (estimated at 25MB
above for this Python version and machine), the Python data structures
in <code>topo.sim</code> (reported as 10MB by <code>asizeof</code>),
and the weight and activity Numpy matrices (reported as 15MB by
<code>n_bytes</code>).  As the formatting of the output suggests,
these numbers should approximately add up, i.e. 52MB should be
approximately the sum of (25MB + 10MB + 15MB), which at 50MB is true
in this case.  Thus in this simulation, there is relatively little
that can be optimized, as 80% (40MB) is taken by system libraries and
essential objects such as the network weights and activities.  Other
simulations <i>do</i> offer potential optimization, e.g.:

<pre>
$ ./topographica -a -c "from topo.misc import memuse" \
-c "memuse.memuse_batch('examples/lissom.ty',retina_density=24,\
lgn_density=24,cortex_density=48,dims=['or','od','dr','dy','cr','sf'])"
...
topsize:1.4g =? code + simsize:869MB + wtsize:389MB (1259MB tot)
</pre>

Here <?php fnref('topo.misc.memuse','memuse_batch') ?> has been
used to evaluate memory usage in a large number of simulations with
different parameters, and in this particular simulation the code,
libraries, activities, and weights account for only 30% of the memory
requirements ((389+25)/1400).  Thus this example has a large potential
for memory usage optimization.


<H2>Heapy</H2>

The above routines can be used to determine when memory usage
optimization might be worthwhile, by making it clear when memory is
taken by Python's internal data structures.  Actually doing the
optimization requires careful consideration of the details of how
Python and Topographica allocate memory in specific cases.  <?php
fnref('topo.misc.asizeof','asizeof') ?> can be useful in this
respect, but much more detailed information is available from
an external program
<a href="http://guppy-pe.sourceforge.net/#Heapy">Heapy</a>, which can
be installed using:

<pre>
$ make -C external guppy
</pre>

<P>Heapy will give you output similar to a performance profiler, but
for memory usage.  For example:

<pre>
$ ./topographica -i \
-p 'cortex_density=retina_density=24' -p lgn_density=10 \
-p 'dims=["or","od","dr","cr","sf"]' \
-c "from guppy import hpy; h=hpy(); h.setrelheap()" \
...
>>> execfile('examples/lissom.ty')
>>> heap=h.heap()
>>> heap

<399 more rows. Type e.g. '_.more' to view.>
</pre>

<P>This output indicates that the single largest component of the
memory usage is for a set of objects of type <code>dict</code>, while
in most properly optimized Topographica simulations the memory
requirements should be dominated by objects of type numpy.floatXX (the
activity and weight matrices).

<P>We can find out more by examining the details for each group of
items above.  For instance, heap partition index 0 (which is a group
of dict objects that together take 21% of the memory) can be examined
by looking at <code>heap[0]</code>.  First, the identity of the
objects can be seen using <code>shpaths</code>:

<pre>
>>> heap[0].shpaths
 0: h.Root.i0_modules['topo'].__dict__['sim'].__dict__['_event_processors']['LeftBlue-RedGreen
LGNOff0'].__dict__['in_connections'][0].__dict__['_SharedWeigh...ion__sharedcf'].__dict__

</pre>

Thus these appear to be the attribute dictionaries of SharedWeightCF
objects, which makes sense for this network because it contains dozens
of LGN sheets connected using SharedWeightCFProjections.  Further
breakdown of what exactly is stored in these dicts can be seen using
<code>referents</code>:

<pre>
>>> heap[0].referents
Partition of a set of 192529 objects. Total size = 7325148 bytes.

     7      1   0       12   0   7325148 100 bool
</pre>

<P>Here it is clear that most of the memory in these dictionaries is
taken by Slice objects, and thus the obvious place to begin
optimization is on the Slice class.  Using this information, we can
start examining Slice to determine how its memory usage can be
reduced.  This process is similar to that for
<a href="optimization.html">performance optimization</a>, but focusing
on memory rather than speed.

<P>Note that <a href="http://guppy-pe.sourceforge.net/heapy_Use.html">
documentation for Heapy</a> is sparse and difficult to follow; it may
be easier to start with some
<a href="http://www.pkgcore.org/trac/pkgcore/doc/dev-notes/heapy.rst">notes
from another developer</a>.
