<H1>Refactoring</H1>
(From <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/">refactoring.com</A>):

<blockquote>
Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing
body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its
external behavior. Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving
transformations. Each transformation (called a 'refactoring') does
little, but a sequence of transformations can produce a significant
restructuring. Since each refactoring is small, it's less likely to go
wrong. The system is also kept fully working after each small
refactoring, reducing the chances that a system can get seriously
broken during the restructuring.
</blockquote>

We rely heavily on refactoring in Topographica to ensure that the
design is always kept up to date and suitable for future scientific
advances.

<H1>Bad smells</H1>

<P>Fowler 1999, <A
HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485672/">Refactoring:
Improving the Design of Existing Code</A>, pp. 417-418) contains a
nice list of "bad smells" in code that drive a developer to want or
need to refactor it:

<ul>
<li> Duplicated Code
<li> Long Method
<li> Large Class
<li> Long Parameter List
<li> Divergent Change
<li> Shotgun Surgery
<li> Feature Envy
<li> Data Clumps
<li> Primitive Obsession
<li> Switch Statements
<li> Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies
<li> Lazy Class
<li> Speculative Generality
<li> Temporary Field
<li> Message Chains
<li> Middle Man
<li> Inappropriate Intimacy
<li> Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces
<li> Incomplete Library Class
<li> Data Class
<li> Refused Bequest
<li> Comments
</ul>

<H1>Refactoring/testing tips</H1>

<P>This list of "soundbites" again comes from Fowler 1999, <A
HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201485672/">Refactoring:
Improving the Design of Existing Code</A>, pp. 417-418).  It seems to
apply reasonably well to this project, particularly the parts about
testing.

<UL>
<LI>Page 7: When you find you have to add a feature to a program, and the
program's code is not structured in a convenient way to add the
feature, first refactor the program to make it easy to add the
feature, then add the feature.

<LI>Page 8: Before you start refactoring, check that you have a solid
suite of tests.  These tests must be self-checking.

<LI>Page 13: Refactoring changes the programs in small steps.  If you make
a mistake, it is easy to find the bug.

<LI>Page 15: Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good
programmers write code that humans can understand.

<LI>Page 53: Refactoring (noun): a change made to the internal structure of
software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without
changing the observable behavior of the software.

<LI>Page 43: Refactor (verb): to restructure software by applying a series
of refactorings without changing the observable behavior of the
software.

<LI>Page 58: Three strikes and you refactor.

<LI>Page 65: Don't publish interfaces prematurely.  Modify your code
ownership policies to smooth refactoring.

<LI>Page 88: When you feel the need to write a comment, first try to
refactor the code so that any comment becomes superfluous.

<LI>Page 90: Make sure all tests are fully automatic and that they check
their own results.

<LI>Page 90: A suite of tests is a powerful bug detector that decapitates
the time it takes to find bugs.

<LI>Page 94: Run your tests frequently.  Localize tests whenever you
compile --- every test at least every day.

<LI>Page 97: When you get a bug report, start by writing a unit test that
exposes the bug.

<LI>Page 98: It is better to write and run incomplete tests than not to
run complete tests.

<LI>Page 99: Think of the boundary conditions under which things might go
wrong and concentrate your tests there.

<LI>Page 100: Don't forget to test that exceptions are raised when things
are expected to go wrong.

<LI>Page 101: Don't let the fear that testing can't catch all bugs stop
you from writing the tests that will catch most bugs.
</ul>
