<P>This manual gives guidelines for developers working on the source
code for the Topographica simulator. Users will not usually need to
refer to this material, unless they plan to submit significant blocks
of code to the project (which is, of course, strongly <a href="#joining">encouraged</a>!).

<P>By default, all the text in this manual refers to program code
written in the Python language. There are also some bits of C/C++ code
in the simulator, which use different conventions.

<P><em>Note that Topographica's documentation may change between
releases, so developers should usually be reading either their locally
built copy of the documentation, or the online <A
HREF="http://buildbot.topographica.org/doc/Developer_Manual/index.html">
nightly documentation build</A>. The documentation at topographica.org
applies to the previous release, so may be out of date with respect to
the current version of Topographica in SVN.</em>
