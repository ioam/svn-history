<P>This manual gives guidelines for developers working on the source
code for the Topographica simulator. Users will not usually need to
refer to this material, unless they plan to submit significant blocks
of code to the project (which is, of course, strongly encouraged!).

<P>By default, all the text in this manual refers to program code
written in the Python language. There are also some bits of C/C++ code
in the simulator, which use different conventions.
