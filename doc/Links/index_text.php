  <dd>Detailed low-level modeling of neurons and small networks.  It is possible
   to use these simulators for topographic maps, but the computational
   requirements are usually extremely high, and typical users simulate
   much smaller networks.  Note that there are now (3/2007) Python
   bindings for Neuron, so it should be practical to wrap a Neuron
   simulation into a Topographica Sheet for analysis.<BR><BR>

  <dd>Highly graphical Java-based simulator covering numerous levels,
    from ion channels to behavioral experiments.  Can be used for some
    of the same types of models supported by Topographica, but does
    not have an explicit focus on topographically organized areas.
    May not currently be maintained.<BR><BR>

  <dt><A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://www.nest-initiative.org">NEST</A></dt>
  <dd>NEST (formerly called BLISS) is a general-purpose simulator for
    large networks of neurons, but without an explicit focus on
    topography.  NEST is based on a custom stack-based scripting
    language (like RPN calculators or PostScript) that is not nearly
    as friendly as Python, and requires much more of the simulation
    code to be written in C.  On the other hand, NEST does provide
    many useful, high-performance primitives, has good parallel
    computer support, and can be particularly useful for models that
    do not fit Topographica's abstractions closely.  NEST now has a
    Python interface, which can be used to wrap a spiking NEST
    simulation as a Topographica sheet.  Thus it is possible to use
    the NEST primitives to develop a model that is then controlled
    at a higher level by Topographica.  Until such an example has
    been put into the Topographica release, contact

  <dt><A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://brain.unr.edu/ncsDocs/">NCS</A></dt>
  <dd>The NCS simulator focuses on large-scale simulation of networks
    of spiking neurons, using C/C++ with a custom specification
    language rather than an extensible scripting language.  Thus it is
    likely to be useful primarily for running simulations very similar
    to those built by the developers, rather than being fully
    extensible as Topographica is.

  <dd>iLab Neuromorphic Vision Toolkit is a high-performance
    computer-vision oriented C++ toolkit from Koch and Itti with support
    for saliency maps for modeling attention.  It has a strong focus
    on topographically organized regions, but at a high level of
    abstraction, and without specific support for learning and
    development.  As for NCS, it also requires more time-consuming and
    less flexible development in C++.<BR><BR>

  <dt><A TARGET="_top" HREF="http://grey.colorado.edu/emergent/index.php/Main_Page">Emergent</A></dt>
  <dd>Formerly called <b>PDP++</b>, Emergent focuses on simulating neural
    networks of various types, for either engineering or cognitive
    science applications.  Although there is support for networks
    arranged as maps (e.g. Kohonen SOMs), the interface is designed to
    make the influence of individual units clear, which is not
    typically useful for analyzing maps.  In any case, Emergent has
    less emphasis on simulating biological experiments and brain
    tissue than does Topographica, instead concentrating on more
    abstract systems that perform specific tasks.<BR><BR>

    abstract backpropagation networks, but also has support for
    Kohonen SOM models of topographic maps).<BR><BR>
