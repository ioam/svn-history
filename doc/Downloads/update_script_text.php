<H2>Updating your scripts for a new version of Topographica</H2>

<P>Topographica is used in current research, and as such it can change
quickly. Sometimes changes are made that render existing code obsolete
in some way. This usually manifests itself in two ways: the first is
that old snapshots can contain out-of-date code, and the second in
that old scripts can contain out-of-date code.

<P>Old snapshots should be supported automatically; if you find you
have an old snapshot that will not load in a newer version of
Topographica, please let us know by <A
HREF="../Forums/problems.html">filing a bug report</A>.

<P>Old scripts can be supported by starting Topographica with legacy
support (i.e. by passing <code>-l</code> to Topographica at startup).
Usually, however, it is better simply to update the script, so that
Topographica does not need to be used with legacy support (which is
not as well tested as current code). As of 0.9.4, we provide a utility
to update scripts to run with newer versions, though it is not
guaranteed to convert every script properly.


<H3>Upgrading from 0.9.5 to 0.9.6</H3>

<P>To update a script (e.g. <code>/home/user/my_script.ty</code>)
written for 0.9.4, first update to 0.9.5 as described below.

<P>To update your script from 0.9.5, change to your topographica/
directory, e.g.:

<pre>
$ cd /home/user/topographica
</pre>

and run the update utility:

<pre>
$ etc/update_095_to_096 /home/user/my_script.ty
</pre>

This will produce a new script,
<code>/home/user/my_script.ty_0.9.6</code>, which should run on the
latest version of Topographica.  Some of the changes will require manual
editing, e.g. to fix the numbers of parentheses in some expression,
but these should be relatively simple to correct in the .ty file.

<P>If you find the script still will not run, please <A
HREF="../Forums/problems.html">file a bug report</A> so that we can
fix the problem. (To work with your original script immediately, you
can instead try running Topographica with legacy support enabled, as
described earlier.)

<H3>Upgrading from 0.9.4 to 0.9.5</H3>

<P>To update a script (e.g. <code>/home/user/my_script.ty</code>)
written for 0.9.4, first change to your topographica/ directory, e.g.:

<pre>
$ cd /home/user/topographica
</pre>

Then run the update utility:

<pre>
$ etc/update_094_to_095 /home/user/my_script.ty
</pre>

This will produce a new script,
<code>/home/user/my_script.ty_0.9.5</code>, which should run on the
version 0.9.5 of Topographica. 

<H3>Upgrading from a version prior to 0.9.4</H3>

<P>Currently, we do not explicitly support code written for versions
of Topographica prior to 0.9.4. Depending on the age of the code,
though, such support is possible in theory. Please let us know if you
have an old script (or snapshot) that you need to use in a modern version
of Topographica.
