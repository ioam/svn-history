</small>

<h3>Tasks to be addressed for the 0.9.3 release:</h3>

<ul>

<li>
2006/12/14 (JB): Documentation for the new Numeric is not free. But we
could document differences from the current Numeric documentation for
our users, as we find these differences.
</li>

<li>
2007/02/20 (JB): Upgrade epydoc to the current SVN version to incorporate
recent changes and bugfixes for the Reference Manual.
</li>

<li>
2006/11/09 (CP): Add automatic assignment of topo.sim.name, by taking
the base name of the first .ty file in sys.argv (if any).  Also should
clean up how the window titles are initialized, so that it is done
after a .ty script is loaded (whether on the initial command line or
from the GUI).  (Right now the name is updated only when a window is
first opened, or when learning is done in the topoconsole.)
</li>

<li>
2006/07/07 (CP): Fix normalization to allow negative weights.  Also
consider adding other normalization options, including joint
normalization across all plots with the same name.
</li>

<li>
2006/10/10 (JL): Add FFT plot using Jim's Octave code; shouldn't be
difficult.  Should also be easy to port it to native Python, because
Numeric already includes a 2D FFT (see FFT.fft2d).
</li>

<li>
2006/11/09 (JL): Add plotting of tuning curves and contrast response functions
</li>

<li>
2006/11/09 (JL): Support better saving of results during long batch
runs (e.g. orientation maps and other plots).
</li>

<li>
2006/11/09 (CP/JL): Add support for measuring receptive fields,
perhaps using STRFPAK or a similar approach.
</li>

<li>
2006/11/09 (CP): Add numerical indication of size and brightness scales
to plots, to allow different Projections, etc. to be compared properly.
</li>

<li>
2006/11/09 (CP?): Add support for plotting outstar connections, i.e. outgoing
ConnectionFields.
</li>

<li>
2006/11/09 (RZ): Add support for automatic generation of reports with
statistics about maps, e.g. for estimating perceived quantities.
</li>

<li>
2006/11/09 (JA): Need to implement more of the optimizations from the C++ LISSOM code.
</li>

<li>
2006/05/15 (JB): Missing scheduled_actions in lissom examples
</li>

<li>
2006/05/24 (JB): Problems with examples/joublin_bc96.ty: strange Projection
plots.
</li>

<li>
2006/11/23 (JB,JL): Matching lissom_oo_or with C++ lissom (do a 'make compare'
to see the current matching status).
</li>


<li>
2006/02/20 (JB): binding help balloon to the widget (already bound to
the label) in parametersframe so that help can be seen for objects
that are e.g. being selected. <br />
CB: I've kind of done this. It doesn't seem to be possible to have a
balloon bound to the options in a ComboBox's list.
</li>


<li>
2007/01/25 (CB): Set order and names of ParametersFrame's Ok, Apply,
Cancel, Reset, and Defaults buttons, and make them behave as expected
for classes and instances.  Figure out and clean up
translator_dictionary & its uses.
</li>

<li>
2007/02/28 (CB): Should add simple timing functions -- what was the total
time to run?  What components are taking a long time to run?  Guide
the user for optimization, focusing on the components we expect to be
the bottlenecks. How do I find out which libraries are being used by
numpy functions? 
<!--Add in general guide & reorganize.-->
</li>

<li>
2007/03/02 (CB): update topographica-win to numpy (plus catchup other
external packages like pyaudiolab & gnosis utils). Test that results from 
Windows version match those from the standard one.
(The current Windows numpy version at scipy.org presumably contains 
the subtract.reduce bug.)
<!--libsndfile, pyaudiolab, jpeg (in PIL binary?), (mlabwrap) to go-->
</li>

</ul>




<h3>Things we hope to take care of eventually</h3>

<ul>


<li>
2007/03/26: Add a wrapper around the Modular Data Processing (MDP) toolkit
(http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net) to provide easy access to the
PCA, ICA, SFA, ISFA, etc. algorithms.
</li>
			     
<li>
2007/03/03 (CB): investigate why this: 
<pre>
from topo.base.patterngenerator import PatternGeneratorParameter
PatternGeneratorParameter.default=topo.patterns.basic.Line()
</pre>
gives errors about being read only sometimes. (Try at 
the commandline, from a script, and saving/loading snapshots.)
</li>

<li>
2007/03/02: Should have an easy way to add things to the right click
menu, just as it is easy to add templates -- it's a very natural way
to add user-defined analyses and plots. (Then test pattern window
could get right-click menu to show e.g. Fourier transform option.)  
</li>

<li>
2007/03/14 (CB): gnosis.xml.pickle needs to be updated for 
numpy. I'm working with module's author at the moment.
</li>

<li>
2007/03/14 (CB): how to build scipy without requiring any of the external
linear algebra libraries, etc? Then scipy would at least build
easily, and users could install the optimized versions if they wished.
Investigate garnumpy.
</li>

<li>
2007/02/23: which version of libraries is numpy using?
<br />
numpy.__config__.show()
<br />
warn users if they're using a slow version?
<br />
http://www.scipy.org/Numpy_Example_List?highlight=%28example%29#head-c7a573f030ff7cbaea62baf219599b3976136bac
</pre>
>>>
>>> import numpy
>>> if id(dot) == id(numpy.core.multiarray.dot):           # A way to know if you use fast blas/lapack or not.
...   print "Not using blas/lapack!"
</pre>
</li>

<li> 
2006/02/04 (JAB): Should work through some of the most commonly used
non-inline-optimized components to see if the implementation can be
tuned slightly for better performance.  For instance, numpy.dot()
appears to be much faster than the current sum(x*y) implementation of
DotProduct:

<pre>
Topographica_t0> import time,numpy,Numeric
Topographica_t0> def runtime(code): start = time.time() ; z = eval(code) ; end = time.time() ; print z, end-start
... 
Topographica_t0> x=2*numpy.ones((1000,10000))
Topographica_t0> y=numpy.ones((1000,10000))
Topographica_t0> runtime("numpy.dot(x.ravel(),y.ravel())")
20000000.0 0.122502088547
Topographica_t0> runtime("numpy.sum(x.ravel()*y.ravel())")
20000000.0 0.312201976776
Topographica_t0> 
Topographica_t0> 
Topographica_t0> x=2*Numeric.ones((1000,10000))
Topographica_t0> y=Numeric.ones((1000,10000))
Topographica_t0> runtime("Numeric.dot(x.flat,y.flat)")
20000000 0.0919671058655
Topographica_t0> runtime("Numeric.sum(x.flat*y.flat)")
20000000 0.358192205429
</pre>

After this, it would be interesting to get some hard numbers about how
much faster the inline-optimized components are than those using numpy
primitives.
</li>

<li>
2006/11/09 (JA?): Need to do a general overhaul of the GUI; it needs to be clean 
and well designed so that it can be flexible.
</li>

<li>
2006/05/23: minor tkgui cleanup? Which widgets should expand
(expand=YES ?), which should fill the space (fill=X ?) (e.g. in
parameters frames sliders etc should expand).
</li>


<li>
2006/11/09 (JL?): Add better support for exploring and optimizing parameter spaces.
</li>

<li>
2007/02/28 (CB): OneDPowerSpectrum(PatternGenerator) and
Audio(OneDPowerSpectrum) (an example of processing auditory data: does
an FFT incrementally on an audio file, delivering part of a
spectrogram at each clock tick).
<!-- doesn't work with test pattern window because plotting expects
2d arrays, I think -->
</li>

<li>
2006/12/21: Could add an option to lock Topographica to real time, so
that once processing is done at a particular virtual time, it waits
until the next real time before moving to the next event (which may be
different due to real-time input arriving by then).  On the other
hand, maybe this isn't necessary?  E.g. everything could be driven
from a PatternGenerator that produces a new pattern whenever some
real-world input arrives, and then the rest of the processing can be
triggered from that, as fast as it can compute.  Worth thinking about,
e.g. to handle simple webcam input.
</li>

<li>
2006/06/03: Allow min_matrix_radius to be set to zero, and then say
that if no unit ends up in the CF, then there will be no CF for that
unit.  But that's going to make the rest of the code hard to write,
because we'll either have to deal with CFs with empty matrices, or
deal with CFs missing altogether.
(As an example, the problem of zero-sized CFs arises in examples/joublin_bc96.ty.)
Maybe it would be simplest to use a non-zero CF size, but with a mask
making no unit visible; not sure.
</li>


<li>
2006/05/19: look at the output from:
<code>bin/python lib/python2.4/site-packages/pychecker/checker.py topo/base/*.py</code>.
Decide which ones of the messages are real problems.  Running it
right now gives 86 warnings, which isn't too hard to imagine looking
at.  Some of them look like things that could be genuinely confusing,
and would be easy to fix (like having local variables named min or
max), and at least one detected an existing hackalert.  Some others
are clearly not problems, but then there is a huge category that I
don't quite understand (like "Function (__init__) uses named
arguments" or "__set__ is not a special method"); those would be worth
understanding.  Once that's done for base/, the rest should be much
easier.
</li>


<li>
2006/06/19 (JB): Number, DynamicNumber: Need to replace the current
implementation with one where Number has a 'dynamic' slot that
can be turned on or off, so that any Number could be dynamic.
Includes making sure something sensible happens in model editor,
and (eventually) making it possible to set their values and
(hopefully) change any Number to be dynamic.
<br />
Need to make sure DynamicNumbers are advanced only once per simulation time.
</li>

<li>
2006/05/15: All arrays should be Numeric.Float32
</li>

<li>
2006/05/22: HACKALERTs relating to connection fields; test file for connectionfield; cleaning up cf.py and projections/basic.py (e.g. DummyCF) along with the Slice class (there are several simplifications that can be made).
</li>

<li>
2006/04/27 (JB): Allowing there to be a slower, more in-depth set of tests
(that don't run with make tests, etc). Required slower tests: that
example networks' results haven't changed [test_script.py], that performance doesn't get worse, ...
</li>

<li>
2006/05/15: Objects in the simulation are indexed by name, so name needs to be a constant Parameter (which <i>might</i> cause some other problems).  There are some related hacks in ParametersFrame that would also need to be cleaned up.
</li>

<li> 
2006/05/02: Finish Slice and SheetCoordinateSystem classes (see ALERTs).
</li>

<li> 
2006/03/17 (JB): Fix problem (matching previous work) with som_retinotopy, at least for small densities.
</li>

<li> 
2006/04/20: many of the tests in testsheet.py run twice - correct that.  See CEBHACKALERT in topo/tests/testsheet.py.
</li>

<li>
2006/04/20 (JB): Complete test file for Composite and Image.
</li>

<li>
2006/02/24: SheetSelectorParameter etc (so that the GUI (model editor) can
display list of sheet classes etc from a Parameter).
</li>

<li>
2006/02/24 (JB): find_classes_in_package() will become a method of ClassSelectorParameter. 
</li>

<li>
2006/02/21: ReadOnlyParameter to allow declaration of something but not let it
be set anywhere else, even in a ParameterizedObject constructor.
</li>

<li>
2006/02/21 (JB): Remove Parameter's hidden attribute, and instead use (e.g. negative) precendence.
</li>

<li>
2006/02/21 (JB): Have size and aspect_ratio Parameters in
PatternGenerator so that subclasses can inherit doc, precedence
attributes (etc), but have them not used unless a subclass does really
use them.  It might be better just to create an abstract PatternGenerator
class for grouping together all patterns using those parameters, which shouldn't be too hard. 
</li>

<li> 
2006/05/02: investigate failing test in testimage.py (that uses sheet functions).
Currently commented out; may not be a problem.
</li>

<li>
2006/03/07 (JL): make change_bounds() able to enlarge as well as shrink [made a first draft, JL is working with it]
</li>

<li>
2006/06/19: e.g. Filename's search_paths attribute shouldn't be pickled.
Presumably there will be other such items, so should objects have a standard 
attribute/parameter that lists attributes not to pickle? Or something like that.
Otherwise, save_snapshot and load_snapshot could specifically avoid items.
</li>


<!--
<li>
2005/01/01: Could add a web site with results of unit tests, updated nightly
</li>
-->

<li>
2005/01/01: Could consider using or taking components from: SciPy,
ScientificPython, Chaco, Pyro (the robotics package), g, logger
(instead of our custom messaging functions).
</li>

<li>
2005/01/01: Should add support for additive or multiplicative noise, with
many possible places it could be added.
<!-- Also suggested by Geisler, 7/1/2005:
  Package as a Matlab toolbox to get the right people to use it?
  Package it as an easy-to-use out-of-the-box optical imaging simulator
    -- need to tell it what stimulus, what eccentricity, what cortical patch
  Be able to look at the effects of attention
  Add specific models for intrinsic or voltage-sensitive-dye imaging 
-->
</li>

<li>
2005/01/01: Add a mechanism to group Sheets into a logical unit for
plotting, analysis, etc.  For instance, it should be possible to group
three R,G,B sheets into one eye, two ON and OFF sheets into one LGN
area, and several V1 layers into one stack.  Such grouping should
support e.g. presenting a color bitmap to an Eye instead of to R, G,
and B separately, plotting the resulting activation from the three
areas in true color, combining ON and OFF plots into one bitmap (by
subtraction), and measuring a vertically summed orientation map for a
model using several layers.
</li>

<li>
2005/01/01: Finish porting all categories of simulations from parts II
and III of the LISSOM book (i.e. orientation maps, ocular dominance
maps, direction maps, combined maps, face maps, and two-level maps) to
Topographica.
</li>

<!-- From Tue Sep  6 15:32:25 BST 2005 meeting with Eyal

Major issues
____________

Overall, the documentation and software need to separate 'Learning and
self-organization' from 'Representing signals in topographic maps' and
'Understanding topographic maps'.

Should allow the user to specify the parameters and network setup
themselves, instead of having a learned map.  (E.g. select tuning
width, connection types, etc.)

It should also be possible to import a map measured in the lab into
Topographica, then allow the user to try it out by synthesizing a
network based on that data.

More ambitiously, could start out with the above rough sketch of a
network, then auto-optimize parameters to match a set of behavioral
observations. Longer-term project; will need ways to explore the
space of possible models matching those observations.

In general, it would be useful to start with a set of observations,
and select parameters that match that. 

Should be able to specify (parametrically?) the tuning properties, and
of course measure and display those.

Need to have some representation of receptive fields, mapped onto
actual size units in the world.

Need to be able to map things to millimeters of cortex, and degrees of
visual angle.  E.g. need to be able to map measured locations in the
visual cortex into the model, or even map the measured retinotopic
grid directly into the model.

Color lookup tables for plotting: user needs to pick them, and need
to have keys shown as a color bar.  Also needs to control the
baseline, clipping range, etc. and to have a clipping warning light.

For Eyal's work, adding realistic dynamics is key, including being
able to control the time course, e.g. with various delays.  E.g. it
would be great to have a movie showing the time course of an
activation.  Usually they look at an array of activation patterns, 10
images per row, and then average groups of e.g. 10 frames or subsample
them.  They would usually want to simulate to match the measurement
interval, e.g. 100 Hz, then average for display...

Should study how to add noise to the system.  Both neural noise and
measurement noise are important, including e.g. spatial correlations
(due to lateral connections or feedback?) in spontaneous or evoked
activity, and e.g. how they vary with different assumptions about the
connectivity.

In general, it's an open issue how to have a network with a good
dynamic range but still stable, given background levels of activity,
spontaneous activity in darkness, etc.; will be worth studying.


Less crucial points
___________________

For the display, will be useful to have the units displayed on screen,
etc.

For plotting styles, check Shmuel and Grinvald and Fitzpatrick lab
(e.g. does anyone else have OR-colored activity patterns?).

Array of curves plots:
If they start with an image of 1000x1000 pixels, they bin the data to
100x100 pixel blocks, then plot the average time course of the
response, as a single curve for each condition (x is time, y is change
in fluorescence).  Then each of 100 panels will show 5 or 6 different
curves for different experimental conditions.  (Similar to EEG data --
shows spatial location of small differences between conditions.)

Need good plots of receptive fields -- with the location and size
plotted on the retina.

Minor points for the tutorial:

   When we show the plots, we have white outlines around the lateral
   connections, but don't ever explain them. (easily fixed)
  
   Should show a color bar, and allow user to modify the clipping
   range, etc. (not likely to be fixed in LISSOM, but will be done in
   Topographica).
  
   Explain some of the parameters better (should be easily fixed)


Need to add color keys to the Preference Map panels, e.g. by having a
slot for it in the template.

_______________________________________________________________________________

More Eyal comments:

Need to specify what each 'neuron' in the simulation represents.
How many simulated 'neurons' per simulated 'column'?

Why are the lateral excitatory connections so limited and fixed?

It would be nice to include moving stimuli (drifting gratings, random dots etc.)

Display issues;
  
  1) Model editor - not clear how to interpret; how to modify;

  2) State that each little plot in the projection plot shows only the
     connection field of the neuron, not the entire set of afferents from the retina.

  3)      Suggestions for Test pattern window
  a. contrast (0-100%) instead of scale
  b. mean luminance (0-1) instead of offset
  c. Change units for orientation to deg

  (Part of our general project of allowing
   user-configurable units. I think that's the only way to do things
   like this, because the simulator is not limited to vision only, and so
   the underlying units have to be very general.
   See http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/node11.html
   for bg on handling arbitrary units.
 )

Minor
  
3) Say in the tutorial that orientation maps look funny around the
edges, because of the effects of having lateral connections 
that are cut in half at that border.

To figure out:

4) There is no response in V1 to a small square despite a strong
   response in the retina. Does the response get canceled by the
   lateral inhibition?

5) At point 9 in the tutorial, when I press the Normalize toggle I get
   strange activity pattern in the retina and V1 and when I press the
   Normalize toggle again it does not revert to the old response.

<h3>Other work</h3>

Ongoing work with uncertain finishing times.

<ul>
<li>
2006/02/23 (all): Making more things be Parameters, and writing doc strings at the same time. E.g. the x and y widgets in the Unit Weights window can be Numbers with bounds, etc.
</li>

<li> 
2006/02/23 (all): Ensuring classes are declared abstract when they should be, and making sure base and simple classes are imported into packages (i.e. Sheet into topo/sheets/, Projection into topo/projections/, Constant into topo/patterns/, and so on).
</li>

<li>
2006/05/24 (JB): Add a facility for reporting the approximate time spent
in methods of each EventProcessor, to allow simple debugging without having
to use the profiler.  Or at least add the hotshot commands from lissom_or.ty
to a function that can be called easily, which wouldn't be very difficult.
</li>

<li>
2006/02/21: Might someday be interesting to have read-only objects,
aiming at copy-on-write semantics, but this seems quite difficult to
achieve in Python.
</li>

<li>
2006/02/21 (all): Improving documentation and test files; eliminating ALERTs.
</li>

<li>
2007/03/14: Build python on windows with free compiler. Maybe use
pymingw?  At the moment, this seems much more difficult to setup than
the current system, but it might be much easier to maintain.  Before
that, could at least add mingw's msys stuff for a shell and make -
then the tutorial instructions could be followed ('make examples'
etc). (Or, move from a Makefile in examples/ to some kind of
setup.py script? Then Windows users could follow the tutorial.)
<br />
Python for Windows (as distributed by python.org) is built using a
non-free (money,speech) Microsoft compiler (with associated project files):
external/Python-2.4.4/PCbuild/readme.txt.
<br />
Apparently it can be built using a free (money) Microsoft compiler:
http://wiki.python.org/moin/Building_Python_with_the_free_MS_C_Toolkit
<br />
I'm working on this using cygwin at the moment...
</li>

<li>
2007/02/26: Consider moving to IPython, to get command-prompt
completion in the local namespace, debugging in the namespace of the
exception, with easier to follow tracebacks, persistent command
histories, easy interaction with the system shell (using ! to get a
shell and $ to feed it Python variables), and session logging.
</li>

<li>
2007/02/21 (CB): Investigate using Tile (which has become part of
Tkinter now anyway).  Tile looks good on linux and windows (haven't
tried mac but screenshots look good). But, Tile does not have all the
widgets we need yet. Tile uses themes so we can set it to classic and
use Tile + Tkinter widgets and still have a uniform look. This gives
us nothing to begin with, but Tile should eventually have all the
widgets of Tkinter, at which point we can simply set the theme to get
a Topographica which looks 'right' on windows and mac.
<br />
Well, that is almost true. Pmw (which is not compatible with Tile
because of Tile's theme-based approach) provides some things we really
need. The first of these is balloon help. In fact, that is ok to mix
with other widgets; it doesn't need to match the 'theme' since it's
undecorated by the window manager.  The second is the menubar, which
could be replicated in Tkinter easily - except that it doesn't seem to
be possible to bind popup help to individual menu items...a really
useful feature.  [Add note about the others: messagebar, combobox,
radiobutton, etc.]
</li>


</ul>
