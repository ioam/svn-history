<H2>ALERTs in topo.base</H2>

<pre>
Priorities:
8: release 1.0
3: release someday
0: remove alert

* (8) boundingregion.py cleanup

* cf.py
(8) learning rate moves to learning function rather than cfprojection (CEB)
(8) where mask created (by cfprojection/cf)  (CEB)
(8) learning rate a parameter of CFPLearningFn (CEB)
(8) CFPOutputFn mask parameter could be dropped now a masked iterator 
    can be passed in (CEB)
(8) JCALERT! We might want to change the default value of the
### input value to self.src.activity; but it fails, raising a
### type error. It probably has to be clarified why this is
### happening (CEB)
(3) calculation of no. of units (internal)


* functionfamily.py
(8) TransferFn: rename norm_value (CEB)
(8) LearningFn should have learning_rate param 
    (see same alert in cf.py) (CEB)

* projection.py
(8) other SheetMask + subclasses cleanup 

* Slice
(8) M[slice]-style syntax (first figuring out performance implications
of attribute access) (CEB)
(8) general cleanup (CEB)


* PatternGenerator
(8) needs to support plasticity of output functions (after fixing
Pipeline's plasticity support)


* Simulation
(3) EPConnectionEvent always deepcopying data: does it need to?
(8) SomeTimer (also #1432101)
(8) the mess inside run(); how Forever etc is implemented 
(3) PeriodicEventSequence
    ## JPHACKALERT: This should really be refactored into a
    ## PeriodicEvent class that periodically executes a single event,
    ## then the user can construct a periodic sequence using a
    ## combination of PeriodicEvent and EventSequence.  This would
    ## change the behavior if the sequence length is longer than the
    ## period, but I'm not sure how important that is, and it might
    ## actually be useful the other way.
(8) gc alert in simulation.__new__ (CEB)

* Parameters
(3) script_repr: 
# JABALERT: Only partially achieved so far -- objects of the same
# type and parameter values are treated as different, so anything
# for which instantiate == True is reported as being non-default.
(8) ParamOverrides should check_params() (CEB)

<H4>2007/10/26: Update tutorial</H4>
Add a section about plotting 'Orientation tuning fullfield' tuning

more?  Maybe it's getting daunting?

<H4>ConnectionField tests</H4>
no guarantee that code in/related to connectionfield is valid at all
densities (tied to c++ comparisons task).

<H4>2008/08/15 (JB): Cleanup of examples, especially for afferent radii</H4>

Once Kateryna's project completes, should systematically examine the
example files (see above task) and eliminate as many as possible;
several should now be able to be replicated using her master file.  At
the same time, should update most of the examples to use explicit
parameters for v1aff_radius and lgnaff_radius, so that the sizes of
the LGN and retina sheets can be calculated appropriately.  Currently
many of them have a size that includes a term 0.25 as a buffer, yet
the relevant radius to be buffered against is 0.27083.  There is no
difference in the resulting matrix sizes at the default densities, but
for high enough LGN densities we would expect that a few CFs around
the edge would be cut off slightly using the current values.

<H4>2006/11/09 (JA): optimizations from c++</H4>
Need to implement more of the optimizations from the C++ LISSOM code.

<H4>2007/03/26: Support for optimization</H4>
Do we need our own simple timing functions to make it easier for users
to optimize their components (as opposed to the overall Topographica
framework, for which the current profile() commands are appropriate)?
A facility for reporting the approximate time spent in methods of each
EventProcessor?  In any case, provide more guide for the user for
doing optimization, focusing on the components we expect to be the
bottlenecks. Add general advice for optimization to the manual pages.

<H4>2007/03/26: developer page about efficient array computations.</H4>
Measurement of numpy.sum(X)/X.sum()/sum(X) performance. Difference
between simulation results on different platforms (for slow-tests in
Makefile).

<H4>some kind of global time_fn manager?</H4>

We need a test with non-square input sheets, non-square LISSOM sheets,
etc., with both types of non-squareness...and we also need to test
whatever map measurement that we can (e.g. or maps).  Could also add
coverage testing, e.g. using

<H4>2005/01/01: porting other simulations from c++ lissom</H4>
Finish porting all categories of simulations from parts II and III of
the LISSOM book (i.e. orientation maps, ocular dominance maps,
direction maps, combined maps, face maps, and two-level maps) to
Topographica.

<H4>2007/06/07: plotgrouppanel's plots </H4>
Maybe should be one canvas with bitmaps drawn on. Then we'd get
canvas methods (eg postscript()). But right-click code will need
updating. Should be easy to lay out plots on a canvas, just like
the grid() code that we have at the moment.

<H4>Run tkgui in its own thread?</H4>

<H4>2006/02/21: read-only objects</H4>
Might someday be interesting to have read-only objects, aiming at
copy-on-write semantics, but this seems quite difficult to achieve in
Python.


<!-- From Tue Sep  6 15:32:25 BST 2005 meeting with Eyal

Major issues
____________

Overall, the documentation and software need to separate 'Learning and
self-organization' from 'Representing signals in topographic maps' and
'Understanding topographic maps'.

Should allow the user to specify the parameters and network setup
themselves, instead of having a learned map.  (E.g. select tuning
width, connection types, etc.)

It should also be possible to import a map measured in the lab into
Topographica, then allow the user to try it out by synthesizing a
network based on that data.

More ambitiously, could start out with the above rough sketch of a
network, then auto-optimize parameters to match a set of behavioral
observations. Longer-term project; will need ways to explore the
space of possible models matching those observations.

In general, it would be useful to start with a set of observations,
and select parameters that match that. 

Should be able to specify (parametrically?) the tuning properties, and
of course measure and display those.

Need to have some representation of receptive fields, mapped onto
actual size units in the world.

Need to be able to map things to millimeters of cortex, and degrees of
visual angle.  E.g. need to be able to map measured locations in the
visual cortex into the model, or even map the measured retinotopic
grid directly into the model.

Color lookup tables for plotting: user needs to pick them, and need
to have keys shown as a color bar.  Also needs to control the
baseline, clipping range, etc. and to have a clipping warning light.

For Eyal's work, adding realistic dynamics is key, including being
able to control the time course, e.g. with various delays.  E.g. it
would be great to have a movie showing the time course of an
activation.  Usually they look at an array of activation patterns, 10
images per row, and then average groups of e.g. 10 frames or subsample
them.  They would usually want to simulate to match the measurement
interval, e.g. 100 Hz, then average for display...

Should study how to add noise to the system.  Both neural noise and
measurement noise are important, including e.g. spatial correlations
(due to lateral connections or feedback?) in spontaneous or evoked
activity, and e.g. how they vary with different assumptions about the
connectivity.

In general, it's an open issue how to have a network with a good
dynamic range but still stable, given background levels of activity,
spontaneous activity in darkness, etc.; will be worth studying.


Less crucial points
___________________

For the display, will be useful to have the units displayed on screen,
etc.

For plotting styles, check Shmuel and Grinvald and Fitzpatrick lab
(e.g. does anyone else have OR-colored activity patterns?).

Array of curves plots:
If they start with an image of 1000x1000 pixels, they bin the data to
100x100 pixel blocks, then plot the average time course of the
response, as a single curve for each condition (x is time, y is change
in fluorescence).  Then each of 100 panels will show 5 or 6 different
curves for different experimental conditions.  (Similar to EEG data --
shows spatial location of small differences between conditions.)

Need good plots of receptive fields -- with the location and size
plotted on the retina.

Minor points for the tutorial:

   When we show the plots, we have white outlines around the lateral
   connections, but don't ever explain them. (easily fixed)
  
   Should show a color bar, and allow user to modify the clipping
   range, etc. (not likely to be fixed in LISSOM, but will be done in
   Topographica).
  
   Explain some of the parameters better (should be easily fixed)


Need to add color keys to the Preference Map panels, e.g. by having a
slot for it in the template.

_______________________________________________________________________________

More Eyal comments:

Need to specify what each 'neuron' in the simulation represents.
How many simulated 'neurons' per simulated 'column'?

Why are the lateral excitatory connections so limited and fixed?

It would be nice to include moving stimuli (drifting gratings, random dots etc.)

Display issues;
  
  1) Model editor - not clear how to interpret; how to modify;

  2) State that each little plot in the projection plot shows only the
     connection field of the neuron, not the entire set of afferents from the retina.

  3)      Suggestions for Test pattern window
  a. contrast (0-100%) instead of scale
  b. mean luminance (0-1) instead of offset
  c. Change units for orientation to deg

  (Part of our general project of allowing
   user-configurable units. I think that's the only way to do things
   like this, because the simulator is not limited to vision only, and so
   the underlying units have to be very general.
   See http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/manual/node11.html
   for bg on handling arbitrary units.  For example:
     ipython -p physics
       In [1]: x = 3 m/s^2
       In [2]: y = 15 s
       In [3]: x*y
       Out[3]: 45 m/s

   Or maybe use ScientificPython's PhysicalQuantity (alone and in object arrays)
   or "unum"s to represent quantities with units:
   http://books.google.com/books?id=3nR75KSvsq4C&pg=PA169&lpg=PA169&dq=numpy+physicalquantity&source=web&ots=_cmXEC0qpx&sig=JBEz9BlegnIQJor-1BwnAdRTKLE
 )

Minor
  
3) Say in the tutorial that orientation maps look funny around the
edges, because of the effects of having lateral connections 
that are cut in half at that border.

To figure out:

4) There is no response in V1 to a small square despite a strong
   response in the retina. Does the response get canceled by the
   lateral inhibition?

5) At point 9 in the tutorial, when I press the Normalize toggle I get
   strange activity pattern in the retina and V1 and when I press the
   Normalize toggle again it does not revert to the old response.

<!-- Also suggested by Geisler, 7/1/2005:
  Package as a Matlab toolbox to get the right people to use it?
  Package it as an easy-to-use out-of-the-box optical imaging simulator
    -- need to tell it what stimulus, what eccentricity, what cortical patch
  Be able to look at the effects of attention
  Add specific models for intrinsic or voltage-sensitive-dye imaging

Constant into topo/patterns/, and so on).

<H4>2006/02/21 (all): documentation, unit tests</H4>
Improving both, plus eliminating ALERTs.  Could use Sphinx instead of
epydoc for Reference Manual; apparently searchable.

<H4>2007/03/14: building scipy</H4>
how to build scipy without requiring any of the external linear
algebra libraries, etc? Then scipy would at least build easily, and
users could install the optimized versions if they wished.
Investigate garnumpy.

<H4>2007/07/24 (JB): Matlab Toolbox for Dimensionality Reduction</H4>
Consider interfacing to this toolbox, which contains Matlab
implementations of twenty techniques for dimensionality reduction. A
number of these implementations were developed from scratch, whereas
other implementations are based on software that is already available
on the Web.  http://www.cs.unimaas.nl/l.vandermaaten/dr CB: or
consider a python/numpy alternative?
E.g. http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net/

<H4>2007/07/24 (JB): Digital Embryo Workshop</H4>
Consider interfacing to this toolbox, which is handy for generating
novel 3D objects, e.g. to use as training stimuli (perhaps for
somatosensory simulations?).
http://www.psych.ndsu.nodak.edu/brady/downloads.html


<!-- NOTES NEEDING TO BE TURNED INTO TASKS 

Could consider interfacing to PsychoPy (http://www.psychopy.org) or

Unfortunately you can't patch __setattr__ on <type> or
<object>.  Seems like there should be some clever way, but I can't think
of anything off the top of my head.


_________________________________________________________

Effective logging

A very useful suggestion sent in by Robert Kern follows:

I recently happened on a nifty way to keep tidy per-project log files. I made a profile for my project (which is called "parkfield").

    include ipythonrc

    # cancel earlier logfile invocation:

    logfile ''

    execute import time

    execute __cmd = '/Users/kern/research/logfiles/parkfield-%s.log rotate'

    execute __IP.magic_logstart(__cmd % time.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')) 

I also added a shell alias for convenience:

    alias parkfield="ipython -pylab -profile parkfield" 

Now I have a nice little directory with everything I ever type in, organized by project and date.

_________________________________________________________

working with matlab: scipy's io.loadmat 

_________________________________________________________

Something like
assert topo.guimain.tk.call("info","library").endswith("lib/tcl8.5")
could eventually form the basis of a buildbot test on os x that checks
we use Topographica's tcl/tk rather than the system one.


_________________________________________________________


Consider nose unittest extension
http://somethingaboutorange.com/mrl/projects/nose/

_________________________________________________________

have buildbot run make -C examples?


_________________________________________________________

Parameterized.name returns __name__ rather than None?
(this is not Parameterized().name)
